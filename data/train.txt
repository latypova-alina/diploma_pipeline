the O

and O
he O
did O
no O

- O
just O
said O
to O
stay O
off O

When O
I O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
feel O
better O
-he O
just O
said O
he O
hoped O
so O
-what O
is O
that O
supposed O
to O
mean O
? O
? O
Has O
anyone O
had O
any O

Besides O
the O

that O

have O
taken O

that O

help O
my O

All O
to O
no O
avail O
. O
My O
symptoms O
slowly O
crept O
up O
during O
my O
15 O
years O
of O
statin O
use O
. O
Just O
2 O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
walked O
4 O
miles O
a O
day O
, O
or O
rode O
my O
bike O
for O
45 O
minutes O
a O
day O
. O
I O
did O
a O
20 O
minute O
Pilates O
machine O
workout O
4 O
or O
5 O
times O
a O

. O
I O
went O
from O
being O
energetic O
& O
very O
active O
to O
being O
unable O
to O
even O
do O
my O
own O
grocery O

Since O
my O
daughter O
will O
be O
having O
her O
2nd O
child O
in O
3 O
months O
& O
will O
need O
my O
help O
& O
since O
I O
was O
afraid O
that O
I O
would O
be O
wheel O
chair O
bound O
by O
then O
if O
my O
symptoms O
kept O
worsening O
, O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
12 O
days O
ago O
& O
I O
began O
improving O
slightly O
by O
the O
3rd O
day O
. O
I O
informed O
my O
doctor O
, O
who O
was O
not O
happy O
-he O
now O
wants O
me O
to O
"""" O
try O
"""" O
pravachol O
! O
Now O
12 O
days O
post O
-lipitor O
, O
the O
hot O
flashes O
& O
night O
sweats O
are O
gone O
entirely O
. O
I O
am O
sleeping O
5 O
-6 O
hours O
at O

, O
instead O
of O

The O
weakness B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
& I-ADR
back I-ADR
when O
climbing O

is O
lessening O
. O
My O
arm O
muscles O
st O
. O

After O
using O
Lipitor O
for O
2.5 O
years O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
stop O
two O
weeks O
ago O
because O
of O
severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
arm I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
left O
handed O
and O
recently O
could O
n't O
normally O
do O
my O
job O
. O
Twice O
I O
told O
my O
doctor O
about O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
arm I-ADR
and O
he O
did O
n't O
take O
that O
seriously O
, O
ignoring O
my O
complaint O
. O
After O
two O
weeks O
of O
not O
taking O
Lipitor O
my O
arm O
almost O
recovered O
and O
I O
can O
work O
without O
any O
pain B-ADR
or O
any O
problem O
. O
It O
started O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
with O
tingling B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
, O
they O
were O
often O
fall O
asleep O
, O
usually O
when O
I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
From O
month O
to O
month O
pain B-ADR
was O
worst O
until O
I O
almost O
lost B-ADR
all I-ADR
strength I-ADR
and O
could B-ADR
n't I-ADR
use I-ADR
my I-ADR
arm I-ADR
. O
Anyway O
, O
I O
think O
I O
made O
a O
good O
decision O
by O
not O
using O
Lipitor O
anymore O
( O
my O
doctor O
will O
be O
mad O
at O
me O
) O
. O
I O
will O
try O
with O
natural O
supplements O
and O
more O
exercising O
. O
I O
am O
very O
"""" O
anxious O
"""" O
about O
medication O
that O
can O
cause O
myopathy B-DIS
, O
liver B-DIS
damage I-DIS
or O
cancer B-DIS
. O
. O

Slight O

The O
Pain O
is O
80 O
% O
gone O
. O
Limbs O
and O
joints O
are O
so O
much O

are O
so O
much O
more O
limber I-DIS
and O
inflamation O
has O
gone O
down O
amazingly O
. O
Started O
working O
within O
a O
few O
days O
. O

After O
taking O
40 O
mg O
/day O
of O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
I O
started O
to O
notice O
foot B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
diagnosed O
as O
a O
neuroma B-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
right I-DIS
foot I-DIS
, O
then O
a O
hammer B-ADR
toe I-ADR
, O
then O
left B-ADR
heel I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
I O
did O
n't O
connect O
this O
with O
Lipitor O
and O
continued O
to O
take O
it O
. O
I O
saw O
a O
podiatrist O
who O
made O
no O
mention O
of O
the O
connection O
between O
foot B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and O
statins O
. O
One O
day O
a O
pharmacist O
told O
my O
husband O
that O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
connection O
between O
taking O
statins O
and O
foot B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
I O
dc'd O
Lipitor O
6 O
mos O
. O
ago O
, O
and O
my O
foot B-ADR
pain I-ADR
improved O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
I O
still O
have O
some O
daily O
pain B-ADR
and O
discomfort B-ADR
when I-ADR
I I-ADR
walk I-ADR
. O
My O
cholesterol O
numbers O
have O
shot O
up O
, O
but O
I O
wo O
n't O
take O
statins O
again O
. O
I O
' O
m O
afraid O
I O
'll O
become O

I O
'll O

If O
you O
have O
foot B-ADR

while O
on O
a O
statin O
, O
assume O
a O
connection O

and O
assume O
that O
family O

My O
advice O
to O

SHE O
is O
71 O
years O
old O
was O
a O
active O
lady O

She O
would O

After O

this O
medication O
she O
is O
now O
walking B-ADR
with I-ADR
a I-ADR

And O
has O

all O
over O

Back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
Lipitor O
seems O
to O
be O
involved O
. O
In O
November O
of O
2005 O
I O
was O
prescribed O
Lipitor O
for O
elevated B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
. O
Not O
really O
high O
, O
but O
high O
enough O
, O
dosage O
was O
only O
20 O
mg O
per O
day O
. O
Within O
two O
months O
, O
I O
had O
developed O
wicked B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
along O
with O
neuropathy B-ADR
and O
hypersensitivity B-ADR
that I-ADR
wrapped I-ADR
around I-ADR
my I-ADR
abdomen I-ADR
. O
We O
suspected O
the O
Lipitor O
was O
involved O
, O
so O
I O
went O
off O
it O
, O
since O
my O
numbers O
had O
gotten O
really O
low O
. O
I O
was O
effectively O
laid O
up O
for O
about O
six O
months O
. O
Since O
there O
was O
no O
immediate O
improvement O
, O
we O
surmised O
that O
Lipitor O
was O
n't O
causing O
this O
. O
It O
's O
October O
2006 O
now O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
starting O
to O
feel O
more O
like O
myself O
, O
still O
hurts O
but O
I O
can O
work O
around O
it O
. O
The O
cholesterol O
has O
crept O
up O
, O
so O
two O
weeks O
ago O
we O
started O
the O
Lipitor O
again O
, O
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
I O
was O
practically O
flat O
on O
my O
back O
again O
! O
So O
, O
I O
' O
ve O
stopped O
again O
. O
It O
's O
a O
bloody O
shame O
this O
is O
happening O
, O
as O
the O
drug O
was O
extremely O
effective O
in O
dropping O
that O
cholesterol O
. O
Too O
bad O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
try O
something O
else O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

I O
have O
been O
complaining O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
doctors O
about O
severe B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
that O
has O
been O
affecting O
me O
for O
the O
past O
three O
years O
, O
which O
started O
upon O
waking O
one O
morning O
with O
what O
felt B-ADR
like I-ADR
a I-ADR
shark I-ADR
biting I-ADR
into I-ADR
my I-ADR
right I-ADR
calf I-ADR
. O
I O
'd O
been O
taking O
Zocor O
for O
years O
and O
had O
recently O
been O
switched O
to O
Lipitor O
. O
Not O
one O
of O
the O
doctors O
once O
mentioned O
the O
statin O
as O
a O
possible O
cause O
of O
this O
problem O
. O
I O
wake O
up O
each O
morning O
feeling B-ADR
paralyzed I-ADR
all I-ADR
over I-ADR
my I-ADR
body I-ADR
. O
as B-ADR
if I-ADR
I I-ADR
have I-ADR
rigor I-ADR
mortis I-ADR
and I-ADR
am I-ADR
being I-ADR
resurrected I-ADR
from I-ADR
death I-ADR
( I-ADR
no I-ADR

) I-ADR

for O
this O

to O
all O
you O

who O

your O
experiences O
of O
Lipitor O

I O
finally O
have O
my O
answer O

. O
This O
drug O
has O
been O
destroying O
every O
aspect O
of O
my O
life O
. O
physical O
and O
psychological O
. O
It O
's O
destroyed B-ADR
my I-ADR
self I-ADR

, I-ADR
my I-ADR
sex I-ADR
life I-ADR
, O
my O
business O
. O
And O
now O
it O
looks O
and O
feels O
like O
the O
medical O
establishment O
is O
keeping O
it O
all O
a O
dirty O
little O
secret O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
income O
that O
statins O
generate O
. O
I O
'd O
rather O
have O
died O
outright O
from O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
than O
suffer O
as O
I O
have O
the O
past O
three O
years O
. O
And O
, O
reading O
this O

I O
can O
find O
a O
little O
comfort O
in O

Question O
: O
I O
notice O
slight B-ADR
swelling I-ADR
of I-ADR
cheeks I-ADR
of O
my O
face O
. O
( O
Do O
n't O
think O
I O
need O
a O
face O

yet O
) O
Facial B-ADR
swelling I-ADR
is O
listed O
as O
one O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
but O
my O
nurse O
practitioner O
does O
n't O
say O
anything O
. O
I O
am O
considering O
stopping O
lipitor O
for O
a O
while O
. O

The O
side O
effects O
came O
slowly O
and O
it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
make O
the O
connection O
. O
I O
slowly O
started O
experiencing O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
one I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
joint I-ADR
then O
the O
other O
. O
Then O
deep B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
the O
muscle O
of O
one O
arm O
then O
the O
other O
. O
Finally O
after O
the O
muscles B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
chest I-ADR
started I-ADR
aching I-ADR
and O
insomnia B-ADR
had O
set O
in O
. O
I O
called O
my O
doctor O
who O
took O
me O
off O
the O
10 O
mg O
. O
dosage O
. O
Looking O
back O
I O
realize O
now O
that O
I O
had O
symptoms O
early O
on O
but O
chose O
to O
overlook O
them O
. O
Bad O
choice O
on O
my O
part O
. O
I O
hope O
now O
that O
the O
9 O
months O
of O
taking O
these O
meds O
has O
n't O
caused O
permanent O
damage O
! O
! O
. O
After O
reading O
more O
about O
the O
medication O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
for O
me O
. O
I O
am O
done O
with O
taking O
statins O
. O
I O
will O
control O
my O
cholesterol O
by O
losing O
weight O
, O
exercise O
and O
diet O
. O
It O
did O
lower O
my O
total O
cholesterol O
and O
my O
LDL O
's O
but O
the O
effect O
it O
had O
on O
my O
overall O
well O
being O
was O
too O
devastating O
. O

Started O
out O
with O
fatigue B-ADR
/depression O
and O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
. O
Then O
came O
the O
extreme O
knee B-ADR
pain I-ADR
followed O
by O
hip B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
On O
top O
of O
this O
perpetual O
pain B-ADR
, O
I O
started O
having O
the O
irritable B-ADR
colon I-ADR
accompanied O
by O
three O
years O
of O
diarrhea B-ADR
that O
was O
diagnosed O
as O
colitis B-DIS
. O
I O
recently O
was O
totally O
debilitated O
by O
swelling B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
hands O
. O
My O
family O
convince O
me O
to O
stop O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
after O
my O
daughter O
found O
this O
site O
and O
after O
4 O
DAYS O
- O
no O
swelling B-ADR
and O
the O
pain B-ADR
has O
subsided O
! O
! O
! O
I O
am O
interested O
in O
trying O
some O
of O
the O
natural O
options O
stated O
in O
this O
site O
to O
see O
if O
I O
can O
control O
my O
cholesterol O
( O

at O
the O
highest O
. O
Thanks O
to O
everyone O
who O
has O
enlighted O
me!!!. O
Time O
for O
the O
government O
to O
look O
into O
this O
drug O
. O
Do O
n't O
you O
think O
it O
is O
interesting O
that O
the O
medical O
field O
has O
recommended O
that O
your O
cholesterol O
should O
now O
be O
170 O
when O
just O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
200 O
was O
good O
enough O
? O
? O
! O
! O
Sounds O
as O
though O
the O
pharmaceuticals O
companies O
need O
to O
sell O
more O
statins O
. O

Took O
for O
5 O
years O

It O
may O

be O
very O

check O
out O

what O
the O

So O
sad O
to O

Progressively O

. O
Doctor O
has O
ran O
all O
sorts O
of O
tests O
and O
could O
n't O
find O
anything O
wrong O
, O
everyone O
was O
pointing O
to O
arthritis B-DIS
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
and O
many O
of O
the O
problems O
went O
away O
after O
2 O
days O
. O
I O
' O
m O
not O
going O
back O
to O
it O
. O

very O
persistent B-ADR
dry I-ADR
skin I-ADR
spots I-ADR
especially O
on O
my O
legs O
. O
Some O
leg B-ADR
pains I-ADR
at O
first O
, O
reduced O
with O
time O
. O
small O
amounts O
of O
gas B-ADR
, O
but O
almost O
constantly O
. O

Extreme O
burning B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
and O
numbing B-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
feet I-ADR
that O
progressively O
got O
worse O
. O
had O
to O
stop O
after O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
. O
Burning B-ADR
went O
away O
with O
3 O
days O
. O

Works O
just O
fine O
. O
If O
there O
are O
any O
side O
effects O
, O
they O
are O
definitely O
not O
noticeable O
. O
What O
's O
with O
all O
these O
older O
people O
( O
70's)complaining O
about O
the O
lack B-DIS
of I-DIS
sex I-DIS
drive I-DIS
? O
Are O
you O
guys O
being O
realistic O
? O
How O
much O
of O
what O
you O
are O
complaining O
about O
is O
simply O
related O
to O
getting O
older O
? O
. O

I O
was O
prescribed O
this O
drug O
because O
I O
had O
spent O
a O
whole O
night O
in O
complete O
agony B-DIS
; O
abdominal B-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
lower B-DIS
back I-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
all O
that O
I O
imagine O
labor B-DIS
pain I-DIS
to O
be O
, O
except O
I O
was O
not O
in O
labor O
. O
Though O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
pain B-DIS
remains O
undetermined O
, O
the O
Arthritic O
combined O
with O
Paracetamol O
pretty O
much O
eliminated O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
This O
was O
a O
big O
relief O
, O
as O
the O
1200 O
MG O
of O
Ibuprofen O
I O
had O
taken O
throughout O
the O
night O
had O
done O
nothing O
. O
I O
only O
took O
1 O
Arthritic O
and O
1 O
Paracetamol O
and O
that O
did O
the O
trick O
. O
HOWEVER O
: O
I O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
headache B-ADR
yesterday O
and O
Ibuprofen O
again O
did O
n't O
work O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
other O
Arthritic O
pills O
left O
, O
so O
I O
took O
one O
. O
Although O
it O
alleviated O
the O
pain B-DIS
, O
I O
got O
up O
this O
morning O
with O
heavy B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
even O
though O
my O
period O
ended O
last O
week O
. O
I O
was O
relieved O
to O
read O
that O
this O
could O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
as O
it O
means O
I O
probably O
do O
n't O
have O
something O
serious O
, O
but O
I O
will O
have O
to O
be O
in O
some O
serious B-DIS
pain I-DIS
to O
risk O
bleeding B-DIS
from I-DIS
the I-DIS
vagina I-DIS
again O
. O
Next O
time O
I O
'll O
try O
my O
luck O
with O
Paracetamol O
. O
The O
pill O
I O
took O
consisted O
of O
50 O
MG O
Diclofenac O
and O
200 O
MG O
Misoprostol O
. O

Aches B-ADR
and I-ADR
pain I-ADR
from I-ADR
head I-ADR
to I-ADR
toe I-ADR
, O
very B-ADR
grouchy I-ADR
. O
I O
have O
been O
competitive O
in O
road O
racing O
for O
almost O
20 O
years O
, O
but O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
I O
began O
to O
notice O
my O
performance O
falling O
off O
. O
Later O
I O
got O
pains B-ADR
so I-ADR
bad I-ADR
that O
I O
could O
not O
run O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
this O
drug O
and O
after O
about O
3 O
months O
am O
almost O
back O
where O
I O
was O
with O
my O
running O
. O
I O
detest O
lawyers O
, O
but O
statin O
class O
drugs O
are O
crying O
out O
for O
a O
class O
action O
lawsuit O
to O
stop O
their O
use O
. O

I O
added O
a O
rating O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
. O
At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
just O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
after O
only O
three O
weeks O
because O
of O
the O
major O
side O
effects O
I O
experienced O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
have O
lifted O
however O
I O
am O
still O
experiencing O
sore B-ADR
and I-ADR
stiff I-ADR
hips I-ADR
, I-ADR
knees I-ADR
, I-ADR
ankles I-ADR
and I-ADR
feet I-ADR
. O
I O
feel O
like O
the O
lower O
half O
of O
my O
body O
belongs O
to O
a O
much O
older O
person O
than O
me O
, O
I O
' O
m O
only O
48 O
years O
old O
but O
feel O
90 O
. O
I O
am O
very O
concerned O
that O
I O
may O
have O
permanent O
damage O
done O
to O
my O
legs O
because O
of O
only O
three O
weeks O
on O
this O
drug O
. O
Is O
anyone O
else O
experiencing O
this O
lasting O
effect O
from O
Lipitor O
? O
. O

After O
almost O
1 O
year O
on O
10 O
mg O
/day O
, O
woke O
up O
one O
morning O
with O
right O
foot B-ADR
turned I-ADR
at I-ADR

. O
Unable O

for O
it O
. O
Walked O

that O
for O
about O
six O
months O
with O
increasing O
pain B-ADR
, I-ADR
especially I-ADR
in I-ADR
right I-ADR
thigh I-ADR
which O
felt O
. O
I O
' O
m O
so O
disillusioned O
with O
the O
drug O
companies O
and O
the O
FDA O
that O
I O
wo O
n't O
take O
anything O
my O
doctor O
recommends O
again O
. O
Lipitor O
has O
robbed O
me O
and O
my O
family O
of O
my O
former O
active O
self O
and O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
whether O
I O
will O
ever O
return O
to O
normal O
. O
Will O
try O
the O
coq10 O
idea O
and O
also O
physical O
therapy O
to O
try O
to O
realign O
everything O
from O
my O
hips O
down O
so O
I O
can O
move O
normally O
again O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O

I O

Due O

some O
early O

taking O

time O

not O

Second O

We O

I O
want O

When O
we O

I O
went O

was O

people O
on O

other O
statins O

but O
I O
had O
two O
reactions O
this O
past O
year O
to O
Lipitor O
first O
and O
then O
later O
to O
the O
Pravachol O
my O
Dr O
switched O
me O
over O
to O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
how O
long O
I O
was O
on O
Lipitor O
( O
maybe O
8 O
-10 O
months O
) O
. O
I O
was O
on O
Pravachol O
for O
2 O
months O
when O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
similar O
problems O
. O
Stopped O
statins O
4 O
months O
ago O
. O
still O
having O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
but O
there O
was O
a O
dramatic O
decrease O
in O
symptoms O
after O
stopping O
both O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
the O
Pravachol O
. O

Rough O
anxiety B-DIS
and O
paranoia B-ADR
. O
To O
be O
fair O
, O
I O
must O
note O
that O
I O
was O
also O
taking O
Neovasc O
- O
a O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
pill O
and O
when O
the O
above O
symptoms O
persisted O
I O
stopped O
Neovasc O
at O
once O
( O
replaced O
with O
Diovan O
) O
. O
However O
, O
at O
that O
time O
- O
over O
a O
month O
ago O
- O
I O
was O
only O
aware O
of O
Neovasc O
's O
side O
effects O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
when O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
most O
of O
the O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
paranoia B-ADR
symptoms O
disappeared O
- O
most O
, O
but O
not O
all O
. O
That O
is O
when O
I O
started O
looking O
for O
the O
other O
culprit O
. O
Sure O
discovered O
it O
soon O
: O
Lipitor O
. O
Spoke O
to O
a O
psychiatrist O
and O
she O
confirmed O
that O
the O
entire O
family O
of O
Neovasc O
( O
called O
amlodipine O
) O
is O
known O
to O
have O
psychiatric B-ADR
side O
effects O
. O
A O
month O
ago O
my O
family O
physician O
confirmed O
that O
Lipitor O
is O
guilty O
of O
similar O
symptoms O
and O
agreed O
to O
let O
me O
off O
it O
for O
three O
months O
, O
until O
I O
take O
my O
next O
blood O
test O
. O
Meanwhile O
I O
' O
m O
now O
on O
health O
food O
as O
well O
as O
Q10 O
, O
Omega O
III O
, O
Nostril O
and O
Vitamin O
E O
( O
200IU O
) O
. O
I O
now O
hope O
that O
LDL O
is O
low O
enough O
to O
say O
to O
Lipitor O
goodbye O
. O
Time O
will O
tell O
. O

Took O
10 O
mg O
. O
for O
two O
years O
with O
no O
problems O
, O
then O
started O
to O
have O
burning B-ADR
, I-ADR
numb I-ADR
feet I-ADR
in I-ADR
toe I-ADR
area I-ADR
- O
both O
feet O
. O
Also O
, O
had O
discomfort B-ADR
in I-ADR
right I-ADR
side I-ADR
upper I-ADR
and I-ADR
lower I-ADR
of I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
area I-ADR
. O
After O
assorted O
blood O
tests O
which O
were O
all O
normal O
, O
read O
an O
article O
regarding O
neuropathy B-DIS
and O
statins O
drugs O
. O
Stopped O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
slowly O
the O
stomach B-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
went O
away O
, O
but O
two O
years O
later O
my O
feet O
are O
still O
a O
mess O
. O
Would O
not O
take O
this O
or O
any O
other O
statin O
drug O
. O

Always O
very B-ADR
fatigued I-ADR
and O
sleepy B-ADR
immediately O
after O
taking O
the O
drug O
almost O
like O

So O
I O
take O
it O
before O
going O
to O

and O
hot O

cravings O
too O
, O
and O
I O
' O
m O
not O

either O
. O
Periodic O
or O
sporadic B-ADR
lower I-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
without O
the O

and O

. O
Works O
wonders O
on O
my O
bad O
cholesterol O
and O
tri O
's O
but O
now O
my O
good B-ADR
cholesterol I-ADR
is I-ADR
whacked I-ADR
, I-ADR
lowered I-ADR
. O
Ratio O
is O
also O
a O
lot O
better O
but O
the O
lowering O
of O
my O
good O
cholesterol O
has O
my O
doctor O
thinking O
I O
need O
yet O
another O
drug O
to O
bring O
good O
cholesterol O
back O
up O
. O

Paranoia B-ADR
, O
anxiety B-ADR
. O
It O
sure O
reduced O
my O
LDL O
cholesterol O
as O
well O
as O
triglycerides O
- O
but O
the O
psychiatric B-ADR
side I-ADR
effects I-ADR
were O
harsh O
. O

At O
first O
I O
had O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
but O
that O
faded O
out O
. O
Next O
effect O
was O
short B-ADR
term I-ADR
memory I-ADR
: O
I O
would O
gas O
up O
, O
then O
try O
to O
pay O
without O
hanging O
up O
the O
pump O
. O
When O
I O
not O
only O
paid O
someone O
's O
bill O
but O
also O
drove O
off O
WITHOUT O
HANGING O
UP O
THE O
PUMP O
, O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O
While O
it O
did O
lower O
my O
Cholesterol O
numbers O
( O
as O
did O
Simvastatin O
afterwards O
) O
, O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O
Especially O
when O
I O
forget O
something O
important O
to O
my O
job O
and O
which O
I O
should O
have O
overlearned O
from O
years O
of O
gassing O
up O
cars O
. O
Memory O
is O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
cholesterol O
is O
used O
for O
making O
, O
and O
to O
me O
anything O
that O
cuts O
it O
off O
is O
best O
avoided O
. O

I O
only O
took O
20 O
mg O
daily O
for O
2 O
weeks O
- O
several O
days O
after O
stopping O
my O
toes B-ADR
went I-ADR
into I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
spasms I-ADR
. O
Do O
n't O
know O
it O
there O
was O
any O
connection O
. O
After O
only O
2 O
weeks O
on O
Lipitor O
, O
my O
total O
cholesterol O
fell O
from O
306 O
to O
178 O
; O
LDL O
fell O
from O
178 O
to O
70 O
; O
and O
, O
my O
HDL O
went O
from O
116 O
to O
89 O
( O
did O
n't O
like O
this O
result O
, O
but O
did O
like O
the O
change O
in O
the O
LDL O
) O
. O
Overall O
the O
results O
were O
significant O
. O
I O
will O
start O
taking O
it O
again O
as O
my O
cardiologist O
has O
encouraged O
me O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
medication O
. O
After O
reading O
many O
of O
the O

an O
experience O
last O
night O
and O
reading O
some O
postings O
on O

are O
leading O
me O
to O
suspect O
the O
lipitor O
. O
My O
usual O
20 O
mg O
dose O
is O
taken O
with O
dinner O
, O
but O
I O
had O
forgotten O
to O
take O
it O
and O
remembered O
just O
before O
bedtime O
. O
I O
awoke O
at O
3AM O
with O
an O
a O
knee B-ADR
that I-ADR
was I-ADR
just I-ADR
throbbing I-ADR
with I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
I O
hobbled O
to O
the O
bathroom O
and O
took O
a O
dose O
of O
Advil O
and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
back O
to O
sleep O
after O
about O
a O
half O
hour O
. O
I O
awoke O
this O
morning O
with O
about O
a O
50 O
% O
reduction O
in O
pain B-ADR
and O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
subsided O
as O
the O
day O
goes O
on O
. O
I O
will O
never O
take O
lipitor O
before O
bed O
again O
, O
I O
may O
cut O
the O
daily O
dose O
in O
half O
and O
possibly O
stop O
altogether O
if O
the O
pain B-ADR
persists O
at O
an O
intolerable O
level O
. O
Lipitor O
has O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
levels O
to O
the O
180 O
' O
s. O
I O
had O
never O
had O
a O
reading O
below O
218 O
in O
my O
life O
and O
it O
has O
been O
steadily O
rising O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
to O
a O
consistent O
level O
in O
the O

The O
ratio O

bad O
to O
good O

is O
in O
the O
acceptable O
zone O
and O
never O
had O
been O
before O

So O
, O
all O
in O
all O
, O
the O
lipitor O
has O
done O
a O

I O
will O
try O

the O

if O
it O
becomes O
a O

I O
will O
have O
to O
stop O

the O
drug O

Anyone O

This O

The O

did O

only O
take O
it O
5 O

because O
it O
reduces O

it O

I O
have O
my O

about O
all O

Started O
experiencing O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
right I-DIS
heel I-DIS
when O
walking O
in O
mid O
-November O
; O
it O
got O
worse O
over O
time O
so O
I O
went O
to O
see O
my O
orthopedist O
in O
early O
December O
and O
he O
said O
I O
had O
plantar B-DIS
fasciitis I-DIS
; O
he O
showed O
me O
stretching O
exercises O
and O
advised O
me O
to O
get O
inserts O
for O
my O
walking O
shoes O
, O
wear O
cushioned O
house O
slippers O
and O
avoid O
walking O
up O
inclines O
. O
The O
pain B-DIS
lessened O
by O
following O
all O
these O
recommendations O
but O
I O
was O
still O
uncomfortable O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
time O
. O
I O
finally O
went O
to O
see O
the O
orthopedist O
in O
March O
and O
he O
said O
my O
foot O
"""" O
can O
"""" O
improve O
if O
I O
continued O
with O
the O
exercises O
, O
etc O
At O
the O
very O
end O
, O
he O
asked O
if O
he O
had O
given O
me O
the O
"""" O
patch O
"""" O
at O
my O
first O
appointment O
; O
so O
I O
left O
with O
a O
sample O
and O
a O
prescription O
for O
the O
Flector O
patch O
. O
I O
cut O
a O
patch O
( O
there O
are O
five O
in O
each O
reclosable O
pouch O
) O
in O
half O
and O
it O
covers O
the O
heel O
area O
. O
After O
I O
used O
it O
the O
first O
time O
, O
the O
puffiness B-DIS
and O
pain B-DIS
were O
gone O
! O
I O
found O
it O
best O
to O
use O
the O
patch O
at O
night O
only O
although O
you O
can O
replace O
it O
every O
12 O
hours O
. O
I O
put O
the O
patch O
on O
at O
bedtime O
, O
tape O
the O
edges O
down O
and O
wear O
a O
sock O
to O
secure O
it O
. O
Initially O
, O
I O
used O
it O
every O
night O
and O
after O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
was O
able O
to O
cut O
down O
to O
several O
times O
a O
week O
. O
It O
certainly O
helped O
to O
make O
the O
past O
month O
more O
comfortable O
. O

After O
4 O
+ O
years O
I O
' O
ve O
now O
begun O
to O
experience O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
muscle B-ADR

I O
have O
been O
off O

and O
can B-ADR
barely I-ADR
walk I-ADR
. O
I O
hope O
that O
this O
is O
not O
permanent O
. O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
had O
the O
flu B-DIS
bug I-DIS
the O
was O
going O
around O
the O
neighborhood O
. O
I O
had O
taken O

over O
3 O
weeks O
. O
I O
' O
m O
a O
physician O
and O
initially O
figured O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
sports O
related O
( O
although O
being O
right O
handed O
, O
I O
was O
suspicious O
about O
the O
unilateral O
left O
shoulder B-ADR
pain I-ADR
) O
. O
I O
stuck O
it O
out O
for O
3 O
weeks O
until O
I O
had O
a O
significant B-ADR
limp I-ADR
. O
Then O
stopped O
Lipitor O
3 O
days O

and O
noticed O
a O
very O
significant O
mitigation O
of O
the O

about O
80 O

already O
. O
The O

ON O
MY O

amount O
of O
immediate O
relief O

The O
more O
I O

the O

I O
discovered O
how O
much O
better O
I O
felt O
. O
I O
know O
several O
others O
that O
take O
Lipitor O
without O
these O
effects O
. O

Absolutely O
none!. O
I O
was O
originally O
taking O
150 O
mg O
per O
day O
, O
but O
cut O
it O
to O
100 O
mg O
because O
the O
lesser O
dose O
seemed O
to O
work O
as O
well O
. O
My O
internist O
had O
urged O
me O
to O
take O
Vivax O
, O
Celebre O
and O
Extra O
( O
at O
different O
times O
, O
of O
course O
) O
, O
but O
the O
relief O
I O
experienced O
was O
not O
as O
dramatic O
as O
the O
Cataflam O
. O
My O
orthopaedic O
surgeon O
prescribes O
the O
Cataflam O
. O
It O
has O
a O
slight B-ADR
effect I-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
, O
but O
, O
since O
my O
pressure O
is O
usually O
low O
, O
that O
is O
not O
considered O
a O
health O
risk O
. O

Joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
SEVERE B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pain I-ADR
- I-ADR
especially I-ADR
in I-ADR
lower I-ADR
calfs I-ADR

both I-ADR
legs I-ADR

Some O
mornings O
I O
had O
a O
hard B-ADR
time I-ADR
walking I-ADR
. O
Did O
n't O
lower O
cholesterol O
much O
. O
Be O
Very O
Very O
Careful O
using O
this O
drug O
and O
other O
statins O
. O
This O
bad O
stuff O
sneaks O
up O
on O
you O
and O
- O
BAM O
- O
you O
could O
be O
in O
BIG O
trouble O
! O
Was O
on O
this O
and O
then O
Zocor O
for O
a O
total O
of O
3 O
months O
. O
When O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
having O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
they O
admitted O
me O
to O
emergency O
room O
and O
overnight O
stay O
. O
No O
real O
heart O
problems O
- O
but O
weak B-ADR
heart I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
- O
likely O
cause O
of O
Lipitor O
. O
Lower B-ADR
legs I-ADR
have I-ADR
been I-ADR
hurting I-ADR
for O
over O
one O
year O
since O
I O
stopped O
taking O

. O
Doctors O
just O
conducted O
biopsy O
of O
leg B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
because I-ADR
it I-ADR
is I-ADR
inflamed I-ADR
and O
waiting O
for O
results O
. O
Likely O
not O
good O
. O
Also O
much B-ADR
fatigue I-ADR
then O
- O
and O
now O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
STATINS O
- O
and O
if O
you O
do O
I O
hear O
the O
CQ10 O
is O
a O
good O
protector O
for O
some O
of O
the O
muscle O
damage O
that O
the O
statins O
can O
cause O
. O
Too O
late O
for O
me O
, O
I O
think O
, O
as O
the O
damage O
is O
done O
and O
permanent O
. O

This O

. O
Sleeping O

to O

. O
Have O
to O
sleep O
in O
a O
chair O
most O
nights O
. O
Orthopedist O
seems O
to O
think O
its O
normal O
aging O
( O
I O
' O
m O
only O
55 O
) O
and O
internist O
is O
skeptical O
that O
lipitor O
is O
the O
culprit O
. O
I O
have O
also O
noticed O
that O
I O
have O
short B-ADR
term I-ADR
memory I-ADR
loss I-ADR
and O
am O
easily B-ADR
fatigued I-ADR
. O
After O
reading O
the O
entries O
on O
this O

I O
' O
m O
stopping O
the O
lipitor O
today O
and O
we O
'll O
see O
the O
result O
. O

For O
the O
first O
week O
I O
took O
one O
pill O
at O
bedtime O
, O
but O
then O
switched O
to O
mornings O
with O
breakfast O
. O
I O
experienced O
extreme B-ADR
uterine I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
within O
30 O
minutes O
of O
taking O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
I O
was O
in O
excruciating B-ADR
pain I-ADR
for O
an O
hour O
so O
I O
called O
an O
ambulance O
and O
was O
rushed O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O
Heavy B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
started O
within O
30 O
minutes O
after O
the O
cramping B-ADR
ceased O
. O
Medical O
personnel O
dismissed O
the O
symptoms O
as O
not O
being O
related O
to O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
but O
once O
I O
stopped O
taking O
, O
my O
cramping B-ADR
and O
bleeding B-ADR
stopped O
. O
Subsequent O
uterine O
& O
vaginal O
ultrasounds O
did O
not O
show O
anything O
else O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
. O
My O
OB O
/Gyn O
told O
me O
that O
she O
uses O
misoprostol O
( O
1 O
of O
the O
drugs O
in O
Arthritic O
) O
for O
miscarriages O
& O
advised O
me O

I O
would O
not O
recommend O

If O

after O

i O
came O
across O
the O
website O
about O

effects O
of O
statins O
, O
and O
all O
was O
revealed O
. O
I O
told O
my O

i O
would O
never O
take O
statins O
again O
. O
I O
stopped O
them O
about O
eight O
weeks O

have O
gone O
from O
bad O
to O
worse O
in O
most O
terrie B-ADR
pain I-ADR

no O
painkillers O
have O
any O

even O

, O
last O
night O
I O
cried O
with O

but O
there O
does O
not O
seem O

. O
I O
now O
warn O
all O
my O
friends O
about O
statins O
and O
their O
side O

Abdominal B-ADR

STOP O

I O
could B-ADR

I O

they O
did O

work O

Stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
felt O
better O
. O
I O
noticed O
a O
difference O
within O
a O
week O
. O
These O
drugs O
are O
poison O
and O
should O
be O
taken O
off O
the O

I O
am O
now O
taking O

heal O
my O
body O
. O
From O
all O
the O
reading O
I O
have O
done O
, O
the O
doctor O
should O
have O
told O
me O
to O
take O
this O
because O
the O
statins O
deplete O
your O
body O
of O
coq10 O
. O

I O
started O
Lipitor O
more O
than O
two O
years O

these O
symptoms O

My O

been O
affected O
by O
this O

May O

If O

The O
good O
news O
was O
that O
my O

dropped O
from O
269 O
to O
160 O

The O
bad O
news O
was O
that O
long O

it O
would O
likely O
impact O
the O

Once O
the O

On O
advice O
of O
physician O
added O
Tricot O
145 O
mg O
to O
reduce O

Combination O
was O
very O
effective O
- O

Side O
effects O
increased O
noticeably O
a O
few O
months O
after O
starting O
tricot O
. O
About O
4 O
months O
after O
starting O
tricot O
, O
spent O
a O
day O
of O
heavy O
physical O
exertion O
( O
shoveling O

Immediately O

side O

increased O

One O
week O
after O

I O
am O
starting O
to O

a O

Belatedly O
reading O
on O
the O

about O
this O
combination O
( O
I O
was O
never O
informed O
that O
physical O

I O
recommend O
extreme O
caution O
with O
this O

The O
drug O
was O
fine O

I O
resent O
the O
pediculous O
high O
price O

I O
have O
switched O
to O
generic O
simvastatin O

am O
actively O
encouraging O

is O
a O
pretty O
high O
price O

I O

Initially O
there O

It O
took O
the O
better O

During O
that O
time O
, O
my O
numbers O
were O
doing O
great O
! O
But O
then O
, O
very O
gradually O
, O
things O
began O
to O
change O
. O
Fatigue B-ADR
was O
the O
first O
symptom O
for O
me O
. O
It O
hit O
hard O
! O
I O
was O
retiring O
at O
9PM O
when O
it O
used O
to O
be O
11:30 O
. O
Then O
the O
muscle B-ADR
and I-ADR
joint I-ADR
pain I-ADR
kicked O
in O
. O
I O
felt B-ADR
much I-ADR
older I-ADR
than I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
. O
My O
family O
noticed O
the O
short B-ADR
term I-ADR
memory I-ADR
loss I-ADR
before O
I O
did O
. O
It O
was O
very O
embarrassing O
for O
me O
. O
The O
blistered B-ADR
rash I-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
and I-ADR
legs I-ADR
had O
me O
concerned O
even O
more O
. O
What O
was O
wrong O
with O
me O
? O
Is O
this O
what O
old O
age(62 O
) O
should O
normally O
bring O
? O
When O
my O
vision B-ADR
became I-ADR
blurry I-ADR
, O
I O
started O
my O
search O
. O
That O
was O
in O
June O
of O
2007 O
. O
By O
August O
07 O
, O
I O
was O
off O
Lipitor O
for O
good O
. O
My O
cardiologist O
tried O
various O
substitutes O
without O
luck O
until O
we O
got O
to O
Simvastatin O
which O
seemed O
to O
work O
without O
the O
side O
effects O
. O

. O
After O
getting O
up O
and O
moving O
around O
, O

would O
subside O
. O
Also O
started O
to O
have O
neck B-ADR

While O
taking O
10 O

I O
have O
experienced O
no O

It O

only O
when O

with O
no O

problem O

I O

I O
just O
turned O
50 O

would O
laugh O
about O
my O

The O
severity O
of O
that O
memory B-ADR

frightened O
me O
enough O
to O
do O
extensive O

I O

stopped O

after O

my O
physician O

He O
fully O
agreed O

Within O
15 O
minutes O
started O
to O
have O
stomach B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
, O
almost O
like O
period B-DIS
cramps I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
on O
the O
toilet O
for O
a O
good O
30 O
minutes O
in O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
My O
uterus B-ADR
starting I-ADR
to I-ADR
have I-ADR
spasms I-ADR
which O
was O
the O
worst B-ADR
pain I-ADR
I I-ADR
have I-ADR
ever I-ADR
experienced I-ADR
, O
I O
got O
some O
nausea B-ADR
from O
the O
pain B-ADR
, O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
in O
a O
ball O
and O
just O
lie O
there O
until O
the O
pain O
subsided O
which O
felt O
like O
an O
eternity O
. O
Then O
when O
the O
pain B-ADR
subsided O
I O
begin O
to O
have O
some O
bleeding B-ADR
and I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
on I-ADR
day I-ADR
12 I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
cycle I-ADR
. O
I O
would O
rather O
die O
than O
take O
this O
drug O
again O
. O
Although O
It O
works O
wonders O
for O
my O
back B-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
to O
go O
through O
the O
uterus B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
and O
find O
a O
sister O
drug O
to O
arthritic O
. O
Its O
weird O
because O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
this O
drug O
off O
and O
on O
for O
about O
4 O
months O
and O
this O
only O
has O
happened O
to O
me O
3 O
times O
, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
way O
of O
knowing O
when O
it O
will O
randomly O
happen O
and O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
to O
take O
that O
risk O
. O
I O
have O
began O
to O
think O
it O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
the O
day O
of O
my O
cycle O
affecting O
how O
bad O
the O
pains O
will O
be O
. O

It O
only O
took O
three O
pills O
only O
one O
a O
day O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
side O
effects O
can O
be O
quite O
dangerous O
. O
On O
the O
first O
night O
my O
heart B-ADR
was I-ADR
thumping I-ADR
pretty O
hard O
all O
night O
and O
weird O
chest B-ADR
pains I-ADR
. O
On O
second O
night O
same O
thing O
plus O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
kidney I-ADR
area I-ADR
as I-ADR
well I-ADR
as I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
. O
The O
third O
night O
was O
all O
of O
the O
night O
before O
plus O
nausea B-ADR
and O
skin B-ADR
irritation I-ADR
. O
The O
side O
effects O
quit O
after O
4rth O
night O
. O
Voltaren O
did O
nothing O
to O
help O
my O
arm O
. O
Even O
with O
a O
full O
stomach O
, O
this O
pill O
can O
be O
very O
hard O
to O
handle O
. O
Side O
effects O
can O
easily O
bring O
you O
closer O
to O
the O
grave O

However O
, O
I O
started O
to O
have O
these O
symptoms O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
two O
weeks O
before O
I O
started O
the O
Lipitor O
due O
to O
a O
viral B-DIS
upper I-DIS
respiratory I-DIS
infection I-DIS
. O
These O
symptoms O
increased O
with O
Lipitor O
and O
lessened O
when O
I O
went O
off O
it O
. O
Wondering O
if O
metabolic O
changes O
battling O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
is O
the O
cause O
rather O
than O
the O
drug O
formulation O
itself O
. O
I O
will O
try O
taking O
Co O

I O
took O
this O

With O

I O

the O

my I-ADR

began O
to O
go O
away O

After O
2 O

I O
knew O

I O
went O

wanted O
me O
to O

to O
your O

if O
I O

Two O

I O
immediately O

will O

I O

the O

Thank O

I O
read O
that O

have O
the O

there O
may O
be O
a O
difference O
in O
how O
the O

is O
released O

It O

not O
EXACTLY O
the O

my O

are O
so O
sore B-ADR
and O
it O

been O
a O
year O
since O
I O
stopped O

I O
' O

concerned O
I O
have O
some O
kind O
of O
permanent O
damage B-ADR

. O
I O
have O
no B-ADR

My O
left O

I O
can O
no O

sit O
crossleted O

I O

I O

anymore O
and O
can O
not O
get O
up O
from O
sitting O

I O
wondered O

at O
first O
, O
if O
I O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
mild B-DIS
stroke I-DIS
but O
found O
this O
website O
and O
realized O
I O
was O
right O
, O
it O
was O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
lowered O
my O

by O
eating O
a O
bowl O
of O
oatmeal O
at O
night O
, O
for O
me O
, O
just O
changing O

was O
the O
trick O

It O
did O
lower O

Some O
added O

otherwise O
I O
put O
down O
the O

My O
dad O
has O
been O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
over O
a O
year O
, O
they O
increased O
his O
dose O
by O
doubling O
it O
. O
Within O
a O
month O
he O
started O
to O
experience O
lower B-ADR
leg I-ADR
weakness I-ADR
, O
cramping B-ADR
of I-ADR
the I-ADR
calf I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
after O
walking O
only O
a O
block O
and O
while O
resting O
. O
He O
read O
an O
article O
about O
Baylor O
, O
Lipitor O
, O
etc O
We O
asked O
his O
M.D. O
about O
this O
& O
he O
told O
us O
that O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
Lipitor O
were O
an O
INFLAMMATORY B-DIS
muscle I-DIS
weakness I-DIS
& I-DIS
degeneration I-DIS
. O
With O
my O
coaxing O
& O
the O
Dr O
's O
okay O
my O
day O
stopped O
Lipitor O
for O
one O
month O
. O
His O
legs O
did O
not O
get O
better O
OR O
worse O
. O
The O
Dr O
's O
have O
him O
so O
worried O
about O
his O
cholesterol O
that O
he O
started O
taking O
it O
again O
. O
He O
is O
now O
so O
debilitated B-ADR
, O
he O
was O
using O
a O
walker O
, O
& O
his O
wheelchair O
is O
being O
delivered O
today O
. O
We O
have O
been O
to O
a O
Neurologist O
, O
Vascular O
Surgeon O
, O
and O
blood O
Dr O
He O
can O
no O
longer O
drive O
. O
He O
has O
reduced B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
below I-ADR
the I-ADR
knees I-ADR
, O
he O
has O
fallen O
4 O
times O
. O
He O
is O
losing B-ADR
the I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
in I-ADR
his I-ADR
right I-ADR
hand I-ADR
and O
the O
inability B-ADR
to I-ADR
perform I-ADR
fine I-ADR
motor I-ADR
skills I-ADR
. O
With O
all O
the O
tests O
he O
has O
had O
to O
rule O
out O
other O
causes O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Lipitor O
is O
the O
culprit O
. O
Until O
the O
dose O
was O
doubled O
my O
dad O
was O
active O
, O
able O
to O
walk O
, O
drive O
, O
and O
enjoy O
life O
. O
If O
Lipitor O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
these O
problems O
, O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
does O
not O
look O
so O
bad O
. O
I O
would O
never O
take O
or O
recommend O
this O
drug O
to O
anyone O
. O
It O
has O
destroyed O
my O
father O
's O
life O
. O

Tiredness B-ADR
, O
both O
physical O
and O
mental O
. O
Brain B-ADR
fog I-ADR
. O
Progressively O
got O
worse O
over O
course O
of O
treatment O
. O
When O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
, O
no O
immediate O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
'd O
assumed O
that O
the O
tiredness B-ADR
was O
just O
one O
of O
those O
things O
that O
happens O
with O
age O
, O
like O
needing O
reading O
glasses O
, O
or O
joints B-DIS
aching I-DIS
in O
the O
cold O
. O
Discovered O
otherwise O
when O
I O
left O
my O
Lipitor O
at O
a O
friend O
's O
house O
, O
asked O
her O
to O
post O
it O
back O
to O
me O
. O
By O
the O
time O
it O
arrived O
a O
few O
days O
later O
I O
was O
feeling O
better O
than O
I O
had O
for O
months O
. O
Had O
previously O
been O
on O
Pravastatin O
, O
my O
doc O
switched O
me O
because O
cholesterol O
was O
still O
too O
high O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
these O
side O
-effects O
either O
. O
Will O
ask O
about O
whether O
any O
point O
in O
switching O
back O
but O
wo O
n't O
take O
Lipitor O
again O
. O
Frankly O
prefer O
quality O
of O
life O
to O
quantity!. O

Constant O
stomach B-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
and I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
distension B-ADR
, O
gas B-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR
aches I-ADR
, O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
Experimentation O
with O
stopping O
the O
treatment O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
brought O
relief O
. O
On O
re O
-starting O
, O
the O
symptoms O
rapidly O
returned O
. O
I O
now O
intend O
to O
ask O
my O
doctor O
for O
an O
alternative O
. O

No O
side O
affects O
. O
This O
pill O
works O
like O
magic O
to O
releve O
my O
arthritic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
! O
I O
do O
n't O
take O
it O
regularly O
, O
only O
when O
required O
- O
approximately O
once O
per O
month O
. O

I O
was O
prescribed O
Disor O
for O
bone B-DIS
and I-DIS
joint I-DIS
pain I-DIS
associated O
with O
Lupus B-DIS
. O
I O
also O
have O
3 O
herniated B-DIS
discs I-DIS
that O
have O
been O
bothering O
me O
for O
years O
, O
and O
for O
which O
I O
have O
always O
taken O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
Vicodin O
( O
almost O
daily O
) O
. O
The O
Disor O
works O
well O
on O
the O
Lupus B-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
but O
also O
almost O
completely O
wiped O
out O
the O
pain B-DIS
from I-DIS
the I-DIS
herniated I-DIS
discs I-DIS
, O
and O
has O
replaced O
my O
usual O
narcotic O
pain O
relief O
for O
my O
back O
. O
As O
with O
any O
disc B-DIS
issues I-DIS
there O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
occasional O
flare O
up O
, O
but O
when O
they O
do O
occur O
now O
they O
are O
minor O
, O
and O
once O
I O
take O
my O
usual O
dose O
of O
Disor O
, O
the O
pain B-DIS
is O
gone O
again O
. O
I O
have O
had O
no O
recognizable O
side O
effects O
. O

Nothing O
unusual O
or O
that O
I O
m O
aware O
of O
. O
I O
have O
some O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
that O
s O
developed O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
which O
may O
not O
be O
related O
since O
it O
runs O
in O
the O
family O
. O
Works O
great O
! O
Hard O
to O
function O
without O
( O
pain),when B-DIS
I O
ran O
out O
. O
I O
m O
probably O
addicted O
to O
it O
. O
Somewhat O
concerned O
about O
the O
long O
term O
effects O
and O
listed O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
so O
I O
' O
ve O
only O
ever O
taken O
arthritic O
50 O
once O
daily O
rather O
than O
twice O
, O
which O
is O
just O
enough O
to O
manage O
my O
pain B-DIS
levels O
. O
I O
feel O
it O
has O
a O
cumulative O
effect O
. O
maybe O
. O
I O
do O
nt O
think O
anything O
will O
completely O
remove O
the O
pain B-DIS
, O
and O
maybe O
should O
nt O
since O
it O
helps O
you O
to O
know O
what O
s O
going O
on O
. O
Else O
how O
much O
would O
you O
have O
to O
take O
, O
thus O
increasing O
your O
risk O
for O
possible O
adverse O
reactions O
. O

It O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
I O
became O
so O
depressed B-ADR
that O
I O
called O
my O
doctor O
and O
told O
her O
I O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
anymore O
. O
I O
think O
this O
effect O
may O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
an O
interaction O
with O
the O
birth O
control O
pill O
. O
it O
lowered O
my O
numbers O
, O
but O
made O
my O
life O
miserable O
. O

I O
took O
this O
drug O
for O
2 O
years O
before O
onset O
of O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
( I-ADR
knees)and O
painful B-ADR
welts I-ADR
on I-ADR
bottom I-ADR
of I-ADR
feet I-ADR
( O
had O
to O
use O
cane O
to O
walk O
) O
. O
Initially O
, O
my O
quack O
MD O
put O
me O
on O
anti O
-inflam O
. O
drugs O
. O
Subsequently O
, O
I O
quit O
the O
drug O
and O
the O
MD O
. O
All O
symptoms O
subsided O
completely O
. O
However O
, O
I O
had O
a O
milder O
reaction O
to O
Zocor O
; O
dizziness B-DIS
with O
Pravachol O
; O
now O
on O
Zeta O
( O
mild B-DIS
joint I-DIS
pain I-DIS
) O
. O
I O
believe O
that O
Lipitor O
left O
me O
with O
permanent B-ADR
joint I-ADR
damage I-ADR
and O
would O
join O
any O
class O
-action O
lawsuit O
relating O
to O
this O
crumby O
drug O

worse O
, O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
much O
worse O
. O
Did O
help O
lower O
my O
bad O
cholesterol O
but O
caused O
me O
to O
crave B-ADR
sweets I-ADR
and I-ADR
carbohydrates I-ADR
. O
Constipation B-ADR
to O
the O
point O
I O
suffered O
bouts B-ADR
of I-ADR
diverticulitis I-ADR
. O
It O
happened O
gradually O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
it O
was O
Lipitor O
, O
neither O
did O
my O
MD O
, O
said O
perhaps O
beginning O
of O
MS B-DIS
or O

. O
I O
hope O
these O
side O
effects O
all O
go O
away O
eventually O

I O

such O

in I-ADR
both I-ADR

in O
my O
upper O

upper O
leg O
by O
my O
hip O

that O
I O
could B-ADR
hardly I-ADR
stand I-ADR
it I-ADR
. O
I O
had O
noticed O
5 O
years O
prior O
to O
this O
that O
my O
muscles O
seemed O
to O
never O
feel O
the O
same O
as O
before O
I O
started O
on O
a O
statin O
drug O

I O
kept O

It O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
could B-ADR
hardly I-ADR
walk I-ADR
after O

for O
any O
period O
of O
time O

I O
finally O
called O
my O
doctor O
and O
was O
advised O
to O
stop O
the O
statin O
drug O
. O
It O
took O
a O
few O
months O
for O
the O
pain B-ADR
to O
subside O
. O
I O
took O
40 O
Mg O
for O
10 O
years O
. O
It O
brought O
my O

down O
but O
I O
could O
not O
stand O
all O
of O
the O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

The O
only O
side O
effect O
that O
I O
experienced O
was O

no O

felt O
the O
before O

symptoms O
almost O
immediately O
. O
At O
first O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
stress B-DIS
of O
Christmas O

However O
I O
did O
consider O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
Lipitor O
I O
read O
in O
other O
websites O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
about O
a O
week O
and O
felt O
somewhat O
better O
, O
Christmas O
over O
by O
then O
, O
once O
again O
I O
considered O
stress B-DIS
as O
the O
cause O
and O
not O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
went O
back O
on O
Lipitor O
about O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
feel O
horrible O
again O
. O
Found O
this O
website O
and O
no O
longer O
doubt O
the O
source O
of O
pain B-ADR
, O
etc O
is O
definitely O
from O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
am O
seeing O
my O
GP O
this O
afternoon O
and O
I O
am O
taking O
myself O
off O
this O
drug O

will O
seek O
a O
natural O
method O
of O
lowering O
my O

My O
mother O
started O
taking O
40 O
mg O
. O
of O
Lipitor O
3 O
months O
ago O
. O
During O
the O
first O
month O
she O
complained O
about O
her O
head B-ADR
hurting I-ADR
. O
She O
began O
getting O
very B-ADR
confused I-ADR
. O
She O
was O
always O
exhausted B-ADR
, O
falling B-ADR
asleep I-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR
. O
Complained O
about O
her O
legs B-ADR
always I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
like I-ADR
lead I-ADR
. O
Within O
the O
last O
six O
weeks O
, O
her O
physical O
health O
has O
deteriorated O
to O
the O
point O
of O
her O
being O
confined O
to O
a O
wheelchair O
, O
in O
constant B-ADR
pain I-ADR
with I-ADR
her I-ADR
shoulders I-ADR

, O
and O
a O
feeling O
like O
her O
whole B-ADR
body I-ADR
hurts I-ADR
. O
She O
shakes O
as O
if O
she O
has O
Parkinsons B-DIS

If O
I O
had O
not O

the O
news O
recently O
about O
the O
two O
men O
suing O
Pfizer O
over O
what O
Lipitor O
had O
done O
to O
their O
lives O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
even O
thought O
about O
that O
being O
the O
cause O
. O
Finding O
this O
website O
confirmed O
it O
. O
I O
have O
taken O
her O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
, O
and O
am O
hoping O
that O
clot O
of O
her O
pain B-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
and O
muscle B-ADR
problems I-ADR
will O
start O
to O
get O
better O
, O
although O
it O
scares O
me O
that O
clot O
of O
people O
are O
saying O
they O
have O
n't O
improved O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
know O
about O
this O
a O
week O
after O
she O
started O
with O
the O
symptoms O
. O
I O
would O
NEVER O
recommend O
this O
drug O
to O
anyone O
! O
It O
has O
ruined O
whatever O
years O
my O
mother O
had O
left O
to O
enjoy O
life O
- O
she O
was O
very O
active O
for O
her O

worked O
very O
well O
; O
it O
took O
about O
a O
month O
for O
noticeable O
results O
, O
but O
the O
relief O
was O
definite O
and O
lasting O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
after O
4 O
-5 O
months O
- O
shoulder O
remained O
ok O
, O
but O
many O
lesser O
aches B-DIS

pains B-DIS
( I-DIS
back I-DIS
, O

, O
etc O
) O
returned O
. O
Clearly O
, O
there O
was O
a O
systemic O

that O
was O
helpful O
as O
well O
. O

sore B-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, O
memory B-ADR
loss I-ADR
, O
insomnia B-ADR
. O
seems O
to O
work O

but O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
way O
. O

severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
left I-ADR
calf I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
only O
on O
lipitor O
for O
2 O
months O
but O
I O
started O
getting O
cramps B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
calf I-ADR
and O
it O
started O
to O
get O
worse O
until O
it O
was O
pain B-ADR
and O
I O
had O
trouble B-ADR
standing I-ADR
for I-ADR
longer I-ADR
periods I-ADR
of I-ADR
time I-ADR
. O
Went O
off O
the O
lipitor O
and O
within O
2 O
days O
my O
calf O
was O
better O
. O
Thank O
God O
I O
only O
took O
it O
for O
2 O
months O
. O
Sure O
, O
it O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
from O
326 O
to O
187 O
but O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
have O
to O
live O
with O
pain B-ADR
. O

Dizziness B-ADR

I O
began O
having O
falls B-ADR
shortly O
after O
starting O
lipitor O
approx O
5years O
ago O
. O
Had O
an O
EEG O
at O
that O
time O
with O
no O
abnormalities O
. O
Had O
another O
EEG O
6months O
ago O
with O
Frontal B-ADR
Lobe I-ADR
abnormalities I-ADR
which O
I O
suspect O
is O
due O
to O
Lipitor O
. O
Started O
on O
20 O
mg O
and O
progressed O
to O
80 O
mg O
. O

Took O
this O
drug O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
. O
Did O
the O
trick O
on O
lowering O
what O
is O
was O
supposed O
to O
, O
but O
I O
suffered O
extreme B-ADR
depression I-ADR
. O
Not O
worth O
the O
suicidal B-ADR
thoughts I-ADR
, O
so O
I O
quit O
taking O
it O
. O

Was O
on O
Lipitor O
10 O
mg O
per O
day O
for O
about O
5 O
years O
and O
experienced O
chronic B-ADR
and I-ADR
acute I-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
which O
gradually O
improved O
but O
seemed O
strange O
to O
me O
because O
I O
had O
n't O
really O
done O
anything O
to O
strain O
my O
back O
muscles O
. O
New O
doc O
gave O
me O
a O
different O
statin O
but O
I O
had O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
so O
he O
put O
me O
on O
Baycol O
. O
Baycol O
was O
removed O
from O
market O
so O
next O
doc O
put O
me O
back O
on O
Lipitor O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
level O
increased O
to O
slightly O
over O
200 O
so O
my O
doc O
increased O
dosage O
to O
40 O
mg O
a O
day O
. O
Hand B-ADR
and I-ADR
leg I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
returned O
. O
Hands O

I O
wore O
a O

sleep O
several O

a O
week O
which O
controlled O
the O
symptoms O
. O
Recently O
developed O
inflammation B-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
foot I-ADR
muscles I-ADR

joints I-ADR
and O
( O
apparently O
) O

Doc O

the O

. O
Depression B-ADR
, O
for O
which O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
taking O
an O
SSRI O
for O
about O
two O
years O
and O
may O
not O
be O
related O
to O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
had O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
( O
over O
350 O
) O
and O
was O
prescribed O
Lipitor O
in O
1996 O
after O
other O
methods O
failed O
to O
have O
much O
effect O
. O
I O
have O
taken O
two O
stress O
tests O
over O
the O
past O
ten O
years O
and O
was O
told O
I O
had O
a O
healthy O
cardiovascular O
system O
with O
no O
trace O
of O
heart B-DIS
disease I-DIS
. O
I O
am O
6 O
' O
tall O
, O
weighed O
177 O
lbs O
. O
, O
and O
considered O
myself O
healthy O
until O
recently O
. O
I O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
pass O
a O
physical O
readiness O
test O
, O
including O
a O
1.5 O
mile O
run O
, O
every O
6 O
months O
because O
I O
' O
m O
in O
the O
military O
. O
I O
took O
myself O
off O
Lipitor O
because O
I O
can O
not O
take O
the O
physical O
readiness O
test O
. O
In O
fact O
I O
need O
a O
cane O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
. O
I O
am O
not O
overweight O
. O
I O
was O
told O
to O
stretch O
and O
exercise O
more O
but O
that O
has O
not O
helped O
my O
symptoms O
, O
which O
have O
continued O
to O
worsen O
. O
Until O
recently O
I O
walked O
to O
work O
and O
shopping O
, O
4 O
or O
5 O
miles O
most O
weekdays O
, O
and O
more O
on O
the O
weekends O
. O
I O
also O
ran O
2 O
miles O
, O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
difficulty B-ADR
walking I-ADR
and O
problems B-ADR
with I-ADR
my I-ADR
balance I-ADR
and O
I O
' O
ve O
gained O
10 O
pounds O
because O
I O
' O
ve O
become O
sedentary O
. O
Two O
days O
after O
taking O
myself O
off O
Lipitor O
my O
feet O
have O
improved O
a O
little O
and O
I O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
resuming O
a O
more O
active O
lifestyle O
. O
I O
think O
my O
symptoms O
are O
a O
result O
of O
Lipitor O
. O

Ok O
for O
a O
while O
but O
then O
started O
having O
severe B-ADR
leg I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pains I-ADR
to O
point O
could O
not O
sleep O
. O
After O
3 O
days O
of O
not O
taking O
it O
, O
most O
leg B-ADR
pain I-ADR
went O
away O
. O
Hopefully O

pain I-ADR
will O
eventually O
go O
away O
. O

) O
. O
Took O
25 O

otherwise O
. O
Will O

sooner O
I O
'll O
stop O
before O
the O
two O

What O
I O
am O
reading O
is O
that O
most O

are O
NOT O
prescribing O
conservative O
dosages O
- O
maybe O
take O
that O
back O
to O
them O
the O
next O

So O
I O

does O
not O
have O
the O

Lipitor O

the O
side O
effects O

this O

medication O
are O
extremely O
alarming O

I O
fail O
to O
comprehend O
why O
this O
medication O
is O
still O
permitted O
to O
be O
on O
the O

as O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
those O

How O

no O

Do O

Surely O
some O

I O
developed O
constipation B-ADR
and O
flatulence B-ADR
, O
which O
I O
had O
rarely O
suffered O
from O
before O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
developed O
hemorrhoids B-ADR
and O
even O
after O
increasing O

and O
correcting O
the O
constipation B-ADR
, O
they O
did O
not O
go O
away O

After O
a O

my O

feeling I-ADR
as I-ADR

it O
touched O
my O

I O
developed O
a O

I O
could O
not O

About O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
I O
started O
to O
get O
muscle B-ADR

made O

After O

The O
weakness B-ADR

my I-ADR

seems O
to O
have O
diminished O
somewhat O
in O
the O
last O

, O
making O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
up O

My O

is O
still O
a O

not O

My O

wanted O
me O
to O
keep O

I O
know O
this O
is O
another O
drug O
that O
will O
follow O
in O
the O

We O

With O

the O

experience O
any O
side O
effects O
at O
all O
on O
10 O
mg O
. O
It O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
In O
my O
2nd O
year O
I O
started O
having O
very O
bad O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
in O
the O
night O
and O
spinning B-ADR
head I-ADR
when O
laying O
down O
. O
In O
the O
8th O
year O
my O
sugar B-ADR
started I-ADR
to I-ADR
go I-ADR
up I-ADR
which O
I O
am O
tested O
for O
every O
6 O

. O
In O
my O
11th O
year O
I O
have O
now O
developed O
Tinnitus B-ADR
( O
ringing B-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
ears I-ADR
) O
as O
well O
as O
still O
all O
the O
above O
side O
effects O
. O
When O
I O
did O
research O
I O
read O
that O
all O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
I O
am O
experiencing O
have O
most O
likely O
been O
cause O
from O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
I O
have O
now O
decided O
to O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
before O
something O
else O
happens O
to O
me O
. O
Too O
bad O
all O
of O
this O
showed O
up O
after O

many O

Prior O
to O
taking O
this O
medication O
I O
felt O
great O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
getting O
back O
to O
my O
old O
self O
again O
. O
I O
have O
been O
off O
lipitor O
for O
almost O
2 O
weeks O
and O
still O
feel B-ADR
pretty I-ADR
lousy I-ADR
. O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
experience O
leg B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
soreness B-ADR
in I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
and O
tiredness B-ADR
. O
I O
am O
otherwise O
a O
healthy O
person O
. O
Recently O
, O
the O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
leg I-ADR
is O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
ca O
n't O
sleep O
on O
that O
side O
at O
night O
. O
My O
doctor O
suggested O
going O
off O
lipitor O
as O
of O
today O
to O
see O
if O
that O
is O
the O
culprit O
. O
I O
will O
post O
another O
message O
when O
I O
stay O
off O
of O
it O
for O
awhile O
. O
I O
really O
do O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
the O
Lipitor O
though O
, O
as O
I O
had O
never O
had O
problems O
prior O
to O
being O
put O
on O
that O
particular O
medicine O
. O

I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor O
in O
December O
2009 O
and O
stopped O
after O
4 O
months O
. O
During O
this O
time O
I O
experienced O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
both I-ADR
shoulders I-ADR
, I-ADR
sometimes I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
neck I-ADR
also O
, O
causing O
me O
to O
wake O
several O
times O
each O
night O
. O
Pain B-ADR
was I-ADR
worse I-ADR
in O
the O
morning O
but O
rarely O
went O
away O
completely O
during O
the O
day O
. O
Most O
mornings O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
wash O
my O
hair O
in O
the O
shower O
as O
I O
was O
unable B-ADR
to I-ADR
reach I-ADR
the I-ADR
top I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
head I-ADR
with I-ADR
my I-ADR
hands I-ADR
. O
Pain B-ADR
and O
restricted B-ADR
movement I-ADR
often O
prevented O
me O
from O
putting O
on O
shoes O
and O
socks O
without O
assistance O
. O
In O
January O
this O
year O
I O
started O
experiencing O
discomfort B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
hand I-ADR
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
Now O
in O
both O
hands O
, O
the O
pain B-ADR
has O
increased O
, O
fingers B-ADR
are I-ADR
swollen I-ADR
and O
movement B-ADR
is I-ADR
restricted I-ADR
. O
My O
wife O
tells O
me O
my O
hands B-ADR
are I-ADR
warm I-ADR
to I-ADR
touch I-ADR
. O
The O
mornings O
are O
worse O
when O
they O
hurt O
the O
most O
, O
movement B-ADR
is I-ADR
restricted I-ADR
and I-ADR
it I-ADR
is I-ADR
impossible I-ADR
to I-ADR
make I-ADR
a I-ADR
fist I-ADR
. O
Ice O
and O
ibuprofen O
gel O
help O
but O
only O
for O
a O
short O
while O
. O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
400 O
mg O
Ibuprofen O
3 O
times O
daily O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
on O
my O
doctors O
advice O
without O
. O
This O
drug O
is O
clearly O
POISON O
to O
so O
many O
people O
and O
perhaps O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
take O
Pfizer O
to O
the O
courts O
. O
However O
I O
do O
believe O
that O
any O
Doctor O
prescribing O
Lipitor O
should O
make O
it O
abundantly O
clear O
to O
the O
patient O
that O
very O
serious O
consequences O
could O
ensue O
that O
would O
cause O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
could O
effect O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
I O
believe O
that O
failure O
to O
do O
so O
is O
a O
serious O
dereliction O
of O
duty O
that O
should O
be O
tested O
with O
complaints O
to O
the O
medical O
authorities O
that O
oversee O
our O
doctors O
and/or O
the O
courts O

I O
saw O
my O
doctor O
about O
this O
today O
and O
he O
suggested O
going O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
causing O
this O
. O
Thank O
you O
all O

hope O
that O

all O
do O
better O
off O

Severe B-ADR

Cholesterol O
went O
down O
drastically O
, O
doctors O
were O
thrilled O
, O
but O
I O
spent O
a O
year O
feeling O
exhausted B-ADR
and O
weak B-ADR
, O
unable B-ADR
to I-ADR
find I-ADR
words I-ADR
or I-ADR
remember I-ADR
names I-ADR
or O
follow O
the O
plot O
of O
a O
movie O
. O
All O
I O
thought O
about O
was O
where O
and O
when O
I O
could O
lie O
down O
. O
I O
was O
hardly B-ADR
able I-ADR
to I-ADR
lift I-ADR
things I-ADR
I O
could O
easily O
lift O
before O
. O
Legs B-ADR
would I-ADR
go I-ADR
wobbly I-ADR
after O
one O
flight O
of O
stairs O
. O
Everything O
was O
exhausting B-ADR
. O
Doing O
the O
shopping O
or O
vacuuming O
was O
like O
climbing O
Everest O
. O
Symptoms O
stopped O
within O
a O
week O
of O
stopping O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
I O
spent O
a O
year O
of O
my O
life O
like O
that O
. O
I O
will O
not O
recommend O
against O
Lipitor O
because O
some O
people O
do O
fine O
on O
it O
but O
I O
wish O
my O
Drs O
. O
had O
been O
more O
open O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
was O
causing O
me O
problems O
. O
The O
only O
side O
effect O
they O
asked O
about O
was O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
which O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
, O
and O
I O
was O
basically O
told O
Lipitor O
does O
n't O
cause O
anything O
else O
. O

I O
developed O

I O
thought O
were O

from O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
getting O
worse O

After O
all O
I O

I O

I O
will O
stop O
taking O
this O
and O
find O
another O
alternative O

On O
10 O
mg O
. O
did O
nt O
seem O
to O
have O
any O
side O
effects O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
went O
from O
256 O
to O
190 O
in O
30 O
days O
-I O
was O
amazed O
but O
then O
after O
another O
month O
my O
cholesterol O
went O
back O
up O
to O
235 O
and O
my O
doctor O
decided O
to O
bump O
up O
my O
dose O
to O
20 O
mg O
. O
that O
s O
when O
the O
severe B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pain I-ADR
started O
and O
very O
debilitating O
-I O
went O
to O
a O
rheumotogologist O
thinking O
it O
was O
lupus B-DIS
or O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
as O
i B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
always I-ADR
had I-ADR
the I-ADR
flu I-ADR
and O
she O
took O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
said O
I O
had O
muscle B-ADR
damage I-ADR
from O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
Do O
the O
benefits O
outweigh O
the O
severe O
side O
effects O
-Pfizer O
says O
it O
's O
rare O
but O
serious O
side O
effects O
-I O
know O
many O
people O
that O
have O
had O
the O
same O
problem O
with O
muscle B-DIS
damage I-DIS
so O
I O
would O
not O
consider O
the O
side O
effect O
to O
be O
rare O
and O
now O
since O
I O
' O
m O
off O
the O
drug O
wonder O
how O
much O
permanent B-ADR
damage I-ADR
to I-ADR
my I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
is O
their O
due O
to O
this O
awful O
drug O
. O

I O
have O
not O
clinically O
proved O
my O
theory O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
strongly O
believe O
that O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
4 O
years O
ended O
up O
giving O
me O
Multiple B-ADR
Sclerosis I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
a O
37 O
yr O
old O
male O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
MS B-ADR
two O
months O
ago O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
was O
it O
's O
highest O
at O
212 O
when O
my O
GP O
prescribed O
the O
drug O
. O
My O
total O
cholesterol O
while O
on O
it O
got O
down O
to O
130 O
ish O
. O
This O
is O
too O
low O
in O
my O
opinion O
and O
my O
body O
began O
attacking O
my O
CNS O
and O
now O
have O
to O
live O
with O
this O
. O
Again O
, O
this O
has O
not O
yet O
proven O

nor O
have O
i O
gone O
down O
that O
road O

The O

possible O
legal O
actions O
against O
Pfizer O
Inc. O
, O
the O
manufacturer O
of O
the O

Lipitor O

Like O
other O
drugs O
in O
its O
class O
( O
the O
statins O

, O
Lipitor O
can O
cause O
elevated B-DIS

In O
clinical O
trials O
, O
this O
occurred O
in O
0.7 O

the O
rate O

Another O
serious O
side O
effect O
of O
Lipitor O

other O

is O
a O
condition O
called O
rhabdomyolysis B-DIS

in O
which O
muscle O

, O
Symptoms O
of O
rhabdomyolysis B-DIS
include O
muscle B-DIS
pain I-DIS

The O
most O

is O
acute B-DIS

pretty O

now O
as O
i O
did O
with O
the O

i O
guess O
it O
all O
boils O
down O

could O
get O
some O

seems O
impossible O

off O

Do O

blocks O

Without O

I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O

Within O
a O
week O
or O
two O
of O
taking O
the O
prescribe O
dose O
, O
I O
began O
developing O
something O
I O
never O
had O
before O
: O
eczema B-ADR
. O
It O
became O
progressively O
worse O
, O
and O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
first O
month O
had O
created O
a O
massive B-ADR
triangular I-ADR
rash I-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
forehead I-ADR
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
patch B-ADR
on I-ADR
one I-ADR
cheek I-ADR
. O
The O
skin B-ADR
was I-ADR
very I-ADR
red I-ADR
and I-ADR
rough I-ADR
, O
and O
made O
public O
life O
miserable O
and O
embarrassing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
and O
the O
rash B-ADR
cleared O
up O
greatly O
, O
but O
has O
NEVER O
gone O
away O
completely O
, O
flaring O
up O
slightly O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
was O
during O
dosing O
with O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
was O
not O
taking O
any O
other O
medications O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
never O
had O
eczema B-ADR
before O
. O
The O
anti O

effect O
of O
Lipitor O
was O
unusually O
strong O
in O
my O
case O
, O
causing O
my O
CHO O
to O
drop O
below O
90 O
( O
from O
a O
baseline O
of O
over O
200 O
) O
. O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
of O
dosing O
, O
my O
physician O
had O
me O
cutting O
the O
smallest O
dose O
tablet O
in O
half O
to O
be O
taken O
once O
a O
day O
. O
Even O
so O
, O
the O
rash B-ADR
continued O
to O
enlarge O
and O
get O
worse O
, O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
stop O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
. O

After O

I O
felt O

then O

then O
a O

. O
My O
Cholesterol O

Why O
would O
my O

recommend O
this O
drug O
? O
. O

None O
that O
I O
know O
of O
. O
I O
am O
concerned O
that O
it O
aggravates B-ADR
my I-ADR
Rhinitis I-ADR
and O
swells B-ADR
the I-ADR
nasal I-ADR
passages I-ADR
. O
After O
taking O
Lipitor O
( O
10 O
mg O
) O
I O
started O
on O
Nason O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O

I O
accidentally O
took O
a O

Started O
with O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
weakness I-ADR
, O
which O
I O
thought O
was O
due O
to O
my O
age O
and O
job O
. O
When O
my O
doctor O
got O
around O
to O
checking O
my O
liver B-ADR
enzymes I-ADR
, I-ADR
they I-ADR
were I-ADR
sky I-ADR
-high I-ADR
. O
My O
doctor O
said O
to O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
immediately O
. O
When O
the O
pain B-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
continued O
, O
the O
doctor O
seemed O
surprised O
. O
The O
problems O
continued O
, O
and O
a O
specialist O
did O
a O
muscle O
biopsy O
. O
It O
showed O
permanent B-ADR
, I-ADR
irreversible I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
damage I-ADR
. O
The O
good O
news O
- O
the O
muscle B-ADR
damage I-ADR
should O
n't O
get O
any O
worse O
. O

it O

me O
soosoo O
sick B-ADR
that O
I O
take O
literally O

I O
a O
going O

that O
I O

kicks O
in O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
and O
tried O
to O
take O
the O
day O
dose O

but O
I O

- O
its O
just O
too O
awful O

If O
I O

this O

I O
could O
not O
do O
daily O

Symptoms O
began O
12 O
weeks O
after O
starting O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
reported O
to O
my O
cardiologist O
and O
internist O
who O
both O
denied O
problems O
were O
related O
to O
Lipitor O
because O
my O
CPT B-ADR
was I-ADR
only I-ADR
mildly I-ADR
elevated I-ADR
( O
250 O
) O
. O
I O
also O
saw O
a O
podiatrist O
, O
chiropractor O
, O
and O
spine O
specialist O
with O
no O
relief O
. O
When O
it O
got O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
take O
it O
anymore O
and O
did O
not O
care O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
I O
took O
myself O
off O
of O
Lipitor O
and O
got O
a O
50 O
% O
improvement O
after O
one O
week O
. O
I O
then O
saw O
a O
neurologist O
who O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
statin B-DIS
induced I-DIS
myalgia I-DIS
. O
He O
said O
he O
sees O
a O
lot O
of O
patients O
with O
slightly B-ADR
elevated I-ADR
CPT I-ADR
that O
many O
physicians O
do O
not O
recognized O
as O
a O
symptom O
of O
a O
statin O
intolerance O
. O
I O
have O
been O
off O
of O
Lipitor O
for O
two O
years O
and O
continue O
to O
improve O
very O
slowly O
, O
but O
I O
still O
suffer O
from O
some O
pain B-ADR
and O
weakness B-ADR
. O
I O
can O
now O
walk O

, O
but O
my O

are I-ADR
still I-ADR
quite I-ADR

at O

. O

Mild B-ADR

. O
Tried O
Crestor O
and O

could O
n't O
tolerate O
the O
side O

. O
Started O
Lipitor O
and O
after O
6 O
weeks O
my O
blood O

showed O
great O

Very O

I O
gave O
Lipitor O
a O
try O
. O

Was O
put O
on O

I O
experienced O
cramping B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
, O
and O
some O
muscle O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
off O
of O
it O
after O
a O
few O
months O
. O
When O
my O
Cholesterol O
shot O
up O
to O
300 O
, O
I O
reconsidered O
and O
tried O
it O
again O
. O
But O
I O
cut O
the O
dosage O
in O
half O
with O
a O
pill O
cutter O
taking O
only O
5 O
mg O
per O
day O
. O
This O
is O
something O
people O
should O
consider O
. O
Where O
the O
first O
time O
my O
cholesterol O
went O
down O
to O
188 O
with O
10 O
mg O
, O
on O
5 O
mg O
it O
went O
down O
to O
198 O
. O
it O
has O
since O
gone O
up O
to O
220 O
on O
that O
dosage O
but O
still O
a O
far O
cry O
from O

But O
now O
( O
after O
about O

CAUSE O

This O
is O
the O
same O
poster O
as O
the O
previous O
posting O
. O
I O
notice O
a O
poster O
attributed O
Bell B-DIS
's I-DIS
palsy I-DIS
to O
lipitor O
. O
I O
too O
had O
Bell B-DIS
's I-DIS
, O
I O
went O
back O
and O
looked O
at O
my O
cholesterol O
chart O
and O
found O
I O
got O
Bell B-DIS
's I-DIS
before O
I O
started O
on O
lipitor O
. O
There O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
consistent O
occurence O
of O
muscle B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and/or O
liver B-DIS
problems I-DIS
but O
I O
wonder O
how O
many O
other O
problems O
are O
not O
really O
attributable O
to O
lipitor O
eg O
see O
my O
Bell B-DIS
's I-DIS
palsy I-DIS
. O
Also O
I O
get O
night B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
but O
I O
have O
had O
occasional O
muscle B-DIS
cramps I-DIS
at O
night O
since O
I O
was O
a O
child O
, O
Maybe O
my O
memory O
is O
n't O
as O
good O
as O
it O
was O
but O
I O
' O
m O
70 O
and O
I O
still O
passed O
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
bar O
exams O
in O
the O
country O
less O
than O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O
However O
I O
do O
n't O
doubt O
that O
some O
unlucky O
people O
are O
having O
bad O
side O
effects O
, O
I O
just O
wonder O
about O
some O
of O
the O
more O
esoteric O
ones O
. O

Lipitor O
works O
fine O
for O
lowering O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
killers O
, O
apparently O
. O
I O
have O
been O
experiencing O
extreme B-ADR
leg I-ADR
weakness I-ADR
and I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
can O
not O
take O
steps O
without O
holding O
on O
or O
going O
up O
on O
my O
knees O
--which O
is O
agony O
. O
After O
reading O
the O
comments O
on O
this O
page O
, O
I O
am O
shocked O
that O
so O
many O
people O
have O
experienced O
the O
same O
symptoms O
( O
weakness B-ADR
, O
etc O
) O
after O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
on O
the O
drug O
7 O
or O
8 O
years O
, O
and O
have O
gone O
off O
before O
when O
leg B-ADR
pain I-ADR
began O
. O
But O
this O
time O
the O
problems O
came O
on O
more O
gradually O
, O
yet O
more O
severely O
. O
They O
include O
stiff B-ADR
neck I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
clumsiness B-ADR
and O
dizziness B-ADR
. O
I O
' O
m O
going O
off O
it O
tonight O
. O

stomack B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
vomited B-ADR
all O
night O
about O
6 O
times O
, O
abdominal B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
then O
i O
got O
severe O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
, O
horrible O
. O
do O
not O
take O
it O
. O

After O
taking O
the O
drug O
for O
7 O
years O
, O
i O
' O
ve O
suddenly O
developed O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
nausea B-ADR
, O
loss B-ADR
of I-ADR
appetite I-ADR
, O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
these O
symptoms O
for O
4 O
weeks O
and O
i O
' O
ve O
just O
realised O
it O
could O
be O
side O
effects O
from O
orthotic O
. O
The O
problem O
is O
if O
i O
stop O
arthritic O
I O
become O
paralysed O
by O
back B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
Seeing O
the O
doctor O
next O
week O
. O
But O
not O
sure O
if O
my O
symptoms O
are O
due O
to O
the O
drug O
as O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
on O
it O
for O
so O
long O
with O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
After O
trying O
several O
nsaids O
with O
side O
effects O
, O
I O
finally O
discovered O
arthritic O
which O
relieved O
the O
pain B-DIS
and O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
usually O
take O
1 O
or O
2 O
a O
day O
and O
when O
the O
pain B-DIS
gets I-DIS
really I-DIS
bad I-DIS
increase O
it O
to O
3 O
a O
day O
for O
one O
or O
two O
weeks O
. O

WHEN O

. O
each O
day O
it O
got O
worse O
and O
my O
shoulder B-ADR
pain I-ADR
was I-ADR
unbearable I-ADR
. O
Because O
of O
Lipitor O
I O
had O
very B-ADR
serious I-ADR
depression I-ADR
and O
thoughts B-ADR
of I-ADR
hurting I-ADR
myself I-ADR
. O
I O
figured O
out O
myself O
to O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
as O
my O
doctor O
never O
connected O
the O
drug O
with O
the O
side O

I O
always O
told O
him O
about O

did O
you O
know O
that O
these O

ALL O

They O
ended O
up O
cutting O
out O
my O

I O
think O
it O
was O

due O
to O
the O
medicine O
. O

Gradually O

At O

heartburn B-ADR
. O
That O
does O
it O
. O
I O
' O
m O
going O
back O
to O
ibuprofen!. O
I O
took O
this O
the O
first O
time O
in O
February O
2008 O
, O
and O
have O
taken O
it O
occasionally O
since O
. O
Basically O
it O
works O
great O
for O
my O
pain B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
live O
with O
the O
side O
effects O
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
believe O
that O
a O
topically O
applied O
gel O
is O
causing O
this O
stuff O
, O
but O
it O
gets O
better O
when O
I O
quit O
using O
it O
and O
returns O
when O
I O
do O
use O
it O
. O
hard B-ADR
to I-ADR
breathe I-ADR
, O
lungs B-ADR
feel I-ADR
heavy I-ADR
, O
general O
feeling O

everything I-ADR
and I-ADR
give I-ADR
up I-ADR
( O
SOOSOO O
not O
my O
personality O
) O
. O
I O
was O
blaming O
my O
antibiotic O
for O
these O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
now O
I O
see O
that O
they O
come O
and O
go O
with O
the O
use O
of O
the O
solarize O
. O
Scary O
. O
let O
me O
be O
the O
first O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
extremely O
porous O
skin O
, O
so O
I O
am O
probably O
absorbing O
a O
higher O
dose O
than O
was O
thought O
likely O
, O
I O
have O
eczema B-DIS
and O
take O
other O
meds O
that O
exfoliate O
my O
skin O
, O
so O
probably O
a O
whopping O
dose O
is O
going O
in O
. O
I O
have O
found O
that O
I O
can O
use O
a O
q O
-tip O
and O
just O
put O
it O
on O
a O
few O
spots O
and O
then O
do O
not O
get O
the O
global O
bad O
effect O
, O
so O
I O
may O
do O
it O
this O
way O
and O
just O
treat O
one O
arm O
at O
a O
time O
, O
then O
one O
leg O
. O

The O
most O
terrible O
muscle B-ADR
spasms I-ADR
in O
legs O
, O
back O
and O

, O
so O

I O
could O
not O

, O

side O
effects O
were O
so O
bad O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
on O
two O
occasions O
. O
The O
last O
time O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
and O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
hospital O
where O
the O
Doctor O
took O
a O
blood O
and O
urine O
test O
and O
told O
me O
that O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
from O
the O
lipitor O

do O

the O

than O
the O

I O
suffered O
after O
taking O
one O
of O
these O
pills O
. O
Do O
n't O
recommend O
at O
all O
. O

this O
was O
the O
last O
shot O
at O
using O
a O
statin O
to O
reduce O
cholesterol O
ldl O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
all O
the O
statin O
drugs O
, O
you O
know O
the O
very O
expensive O
drug O
of O
choice O
for O
all O
the O
doc O
's O
out O
there O
. O
For O
all O
of O
you O
who O
now O
have O
extremely O
low O
LDL O
and O
a O
bad O
case O
of O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
to I-ADR
the I-ADR
extent I-ADR
that I-ADR
it I-ADR
is I-ADR
very I-ADR
arthritic I-ADR
or O
having O
bad O
muscle B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
that O
you O
never O
got O
prior O
to O
the O
drug O
, O
it O
is O
from O
the O
statins O
. O
The O
drug O
is O
able O
to O
decrease O
LDL O
through O
a O
mechanism O
which O
also O
destroys O
and O
depletes O
your O
bodies O
ability O
to O
make O
coq10 O
. O
This O
is O
necessary O
for O
they O
health O
of O
muscles O
and O
joints O
( O
that O
's O
why O
you O
are O
experiencing O
the O
joint B-ADR
pains I-ADR
and O
numbness B-ADR
) O
. O
Remember O
your O
heart O
is O
a O
muscle O
, O
guess O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
it O
with O
the O
depletion O
of O
the O
coq10 O
? O
? O
? O
If O
you O
do O
some O
research O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
all O
these O
statins O
make O
no O
claims O
/nor O
have O
studies O
shown O
them O
to O
reduce O
heart B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
, O
but O
they O
cause O
muscle B-ADR
problems I-ADR
i.e. O
your O
heart O
, O
this O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
put O
younger O
and O
younger O
people O
on O
these O
drugs O
and O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
your O
own O
research O
versus O
just O
listening O
to O
the O
doctor O
who O
wants O
your O
LDL O
down O
to O
like O
below O
130 O
, O
neurosurgeons O
, O
who O
have O
studied O
this O
would O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
get O
it O
all O
too O
low O
. O
And O
just O
because O
your O
test O
come O
back O
and O
show O
your O
liver O
functions O
are O
fine O
and O
do O
n't O
show O
any O
broken O
down O
muscle O
toxins O
in O
the O
blood O
does O
n't O
mean O
the O
lack O
of O
coq10 O
is O
n't O
breaking O
down O
and O
damaging B-ADR
your I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
very O
slowly O
. O
Mine O
always O
showed O
fine O
and O
I O
had O
severe B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
symptoms I-ADR
in I-ADR
knees I-ADR
and I-ADR
hip I-ADR
joints I-ADR
( O
never O
had O
this O
in O
my O
life O
before O
statins O
) O
and O
bad O
muscle B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
( O
also O
never O
got O
those O
until O
statins O
) O
. O
Granted O
is O
you O
have O
high O
blood O
pressure O
, O
high B-DIS
LDL I-DIS
, O
over B-DIS
weight I-DIS
and O
maybe O
smoke O
, O
then O
you O
probably O
need O
something O
to O
lower O
the O
LDL O
, O
if O
you O
only O
have O
high O
LDL O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
. O
Read O
the O
drug O
company O
studies O
, O
they O
even O
say O
it O
may O
help O
prevent O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
when O
you O
have O
3 O
of O
the O
aforementioned O
risk O
factors O
. O

Can O
not O
take O
more O
than O
10 O
mg O
because O
I O
feel B-ADR
drugged I-ADR
on O
any O
stronger O
dose O
. O
The O
10 O
mg O
brings O
my O

to O
the O
cutoff O
point O
. O

no O

at O

I O
would O
never O

this O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
the O

of O

is O

I O
have O
been O

years O
. O
I O
started O
out O
on O
10mgs O
and O
now O
I O

I O
have O
had O
hip O

, O
and O
shoulder O

while O
on O
this O
drug O
. O
I O
have O
seen O
my O
strength B-ADR
decrease I-ADR
dramatically I-ADR
. O
I O
have O
to O
be O
on O
testosterone O

. O
My O
brother O

also O
on O
Lipitor O

has O
had O
recent O

on O

I O
m O
only O

he O
is O
45 O

This O
sounds O
like O
clot O
of O
physical O
problems O
for O
guys O
our O
age O
. O
It O
was O
nt O
until O
he O
mentioned O
that O
he O
had O
heard O
about O
the O
possible O
dangers O
that O
statins O
have O
on O

that O
I O
saw O
all O
of O
these O
other O
people O
and O
their O
problems O
with O
Lipitor O

This O
could O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
many O
things O
that O
I O
have O
been O
suffering O
physically O

I O
am O
getting O
off O
the O

a O

. O
My O

ALL O
of O
the O

nausea B-ADR
. O
which O
progressively O
got O
worse O
the O
longer O
I O
took O
it O
. O
It O
became O
so O
extreme O
- O
it O
was O
causing O
me O
to O
be O
dysfunctional O
. O
The O
final O
week O
it O
turned O
into O
extreme B-ADR
vomiting I-ADR
and O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
flu B-DIS
bug I-DIS
that O
just O
would O
not O
go O
away O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
quit O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
- O
I O
had O
my O
life O
back O
. O
I O
also O
experienced O
memory B-ADR
loss I-ADR
and O
extreme B-ADR
tiredness I-ADR
. O
I O
might O
also O
mention O
that O
I O
started O
on O
10 O
mg O
and O
experienced O
really O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
but O
when O
I O
was O
up'd O
to O
20 O
mg O
it O
all O
started O
to O
go O
downhill O
. O

8 O
hours O
after O
taken O
voltaren O
, O
I O
had O
a O
severe O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
. O
My O
skin B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
it I-ADR
was I-ADR
moving I-ADR
, O
and O
the O
itch B-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
head I-ADR
, O
genitals B-ADR
and I-ADR
lips I-ADR
was I-ADR
excruciating I-ADR
. O
My O
lips B-ADR
started I-ADR
to I-ADR
swell I-ADR
, O
then O
my O
tongue O
. O
Luckily O
I O
had O
an O
pipe O
in O
the O
medicine O
cupboard O
, O
and O
that O
saved O
me O
. O
I O
had O
taken O
this O
medication O
many O
times O
before O
for O
gout B-DIS
and O
a O
bit O
of O
arthritis B-DIS
. O
This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
had O
the O
reaction O
. O
I O
am O
now O
severely O
allergic O
to O
nsaids O
. O

Started O
2 O
years O
ago O
with O
10 O
mg O
then O
6 O
mos O
later O
doc O
upped O
to O
20 O
. O
About O
3 O
mos O
ago O
I O
had O
several O
severe O
left O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
-never O
had O
them O
before O
. O
Then O
about O
2 O
-3 O
weeks O
later O
, O
woke O
up O
and O
could B-ADR
barely I-ADR
stand I-ADR
and I-ADR
walk I-ADR
. O
Legs O
and O
toes O
were O
numb B-ADR
( O
worse O
in O
left O
) O
, O
weak B-ADR
, O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
calves B-ADR
hurt I-ADR
terribly O
. O
Walking O
was O
possible O
but O
only O
with O
intense O
effort O
and O
pain B-ADR
. O
Could O
n't O
stand O
for O
more O
than O
1 O
or O
2 O
minutes O
-too O
painful B-ADR
and O
weak B-ADR
. O
Waited O
a O
couple O
3 O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
clear O
up O
-did O
not O
. O
Went O
to O
doc O
. O
Took O
x O
-rays O
said O
everything O
fine O
, O
blood O
test O
fine O
. O
Interested O
in O
doing O
MRI O
-thinking O
necrotic O
nerve O
in O
lower O
spine O
. O
On O
an O
aside O
he O
said O
stop O
taking O
lipitor O
on O
an O
off O
chance O
it O
may O
be O
an O
uncommon O
reaction O
. O
I O
started O
looking O
up O
lipitor O
reactions O
and O
came O
across O
so O
much O
info O
on O
side O
effects O
it O
was O
startling O
. O
I O
look O
back O
to O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
ago O
when O
I O
no O
longer O
had O
that O
special B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
that I-ADR
all I-ADR
males I-ADR
experience I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
organ I-ADR
and O
a O
decreased B-ADR
sex I-ADR
drive I-ADR
( O
not O
typical O
for O
me O
) O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
attributed O
it O
to O
male B-DIS
menopause I-DIS
-being O
around O
54 O
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O
acupuncturist O
and O
was O
told O
my O
chee O
was O
dry O
. O
Had O
4 O
treatments O
over O
as O
many O
weeks O
. O
Started O
to O
see O
some O
improvement O
. O
At O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
would O
imagine O
someone O
that O
had O
MS B-DIS
would O
feel O
like O
, O
swaying B-ADR
, O
pulling O
myself O
up O
stairs O
, O
dragging B-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
After O
having O
stopped O
lipitor O
and O
acupuncture O
treatments O
, O
I O
would O
say O
I O
am O
at O
about O
50 O
or O
55 O
% O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
continue O
to O
keep O
getting O
better O
as O
this O
has O
really O
hit O
my O
life O
at O
a O
bad O
time O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
did O
go O
down O
but O
If O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
have O
these O
kinds O
of O
problems O
I O
would O
never O
have O
started O
taking O
the O
drug O
nor O
will O
I O
EVER O
AGAIN O
take O
it O
irregardless O
of O
my O
cholesterol O
level O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
those O
who O
have O
not O
had O
any O
lessening O
of O
symptoms O
to O
try O
acupuncture O
. O
It O
ca O
n't O
hurt O
and O
may O
help!. O

My O

Used O
on O
my O

painful B-DIS

within O
minutes O
felt O
relief O
. O
( O
I O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
the O
Advil O
I O
had O
taken O
earlier O
kicking O
in O
) O
However O
, O
several O
days O
later O
, O
had O
a O
flare O
with O
joint B-DIS
pain I-DIS
in I-DIS
wrist I-DIS
. O
Squeezed O
out O
a O
few O
drops O
and O
rubbed O
it O
in O
and O
pain B-DIS
relief O
was O
almost O
immediate O
. O
I O
read O
that O
this O
is O
prescribed O
for O
knee B-DIS
pain I-DIS
but O
my O
doctor O
gave O
me O
a O
sample O
because O
the O
voltaren O
has O
worked O
ok O
for O
me O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
take O
Advil O
a O
lot O
because O
of O
the O
gastro B-DIS
effects I-DIS
. O
Boy O
, O
I O
love O
this O
stuff O
and O
will O
ask O
for O
a O
script O
next O
time O
I O
see O
the O
Rheumy O
. O

I O
stumbled O
across O
this O
website O
which O
was O
nothing O
short O
of O
a O
miracle O
to O
me O
. O
I O
was O
searching O
for O
answers O
on O
why O
I O
am O
in O
such O
pain B-ADR
throughout I-ADR
my I-ADR
body I-ADR
, O
mental B-ADR
confusion I-ADR
at O
times O
and O
also O
short B-ADR
term I-ADR
memory I-ADR
loss I-ADR
which O
all O
seemed O
to O
be O
growing O
steadily O
worse O
for O
the O
past O
few O
years O
. O
I O
blamed O
it O
on O
stress B-DIS
( O
with O
a O
dying O
husband O
) O
, O
arthritis B-DIS
, O
advancing O
age O
etc O
and O
even O
discussed O
leg B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
body B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
with O
my O
doctor O
which O
he O
attributed O
chiefly O
to O
age O
and O
arthritis B-DIS
. O
I O
even O
had O
tests O
done O
on O
arteries O
to O
see O
if O
that O
could O
be O
the O
cause O
as O
I O
have O
an O
aortic B-DIS
aneurysm I-DIS
and O
thought O
perhaps O
my O
problems O
could O
be O
from O
poor B-DIS
circulation I-DIS
or O
blockage O
somewhere O
. O
They O
all O
checked O
out O
okay O
. O
It O
has O
been O
unbearable O
for O
several O
weeks O
now O
off O
and O
on O
and O
I O
suffered O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
lack B-ADR
of I-ADR
energy I-ADR
and O
growing B-ADR
depression I-ADR
and O
a O
feeling B-ADR
a I-ADR
fragility I-ADR
where O
I O
had O
always O
been O
a O
strong O
woman O
until O
recent O
years O
. O
I O
looked O
up O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
thinking O
I O
might O
have O
that O
but O
when O
I O
casually O
looked O
up O
lipitor O
the O
ratings O
leaped O
out O
at O
me O
. O
These O
people O
all O
were O
experiencing O
my O
symptoms O

THANK O

I O
am O
contacting O
my O
doctor O
immediately O
and O
as O
of O
now O
no O
more O
lipitor O
. O
It O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
but O
greatly O
lowered O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
and O
I O
guess O
I O
am O
going O
to O
do O
exercise O
and O
have O
joined O
weight O

and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
control O
it O
in O
that O
manner O

I O
am O
67 O
and O
have O
been O
on O

several O

I O
was O

a O
6 O
day O
trial O
of O
Arthritic O
along O
with O
a O
9 O
day O
trial O
of O
Cipher O
on O
4/25 O
( O
three O
bottles O
of O
three O
pills O
) O
. O
This O
was O
a O
solution O
my O
doctor O
came O
up O
with O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
had O
consistent O
heart B-DIS
burn I-DIS
or O
indigestion B-DIS
, O
no O
signs O
of O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
, O
so O
I O
was O
confused O
as O
to O
why O
he O
would O
offer O
me O
this O
medication O
. O
The O
first O
day O
I O
took O
both O
pills O
, O
I O
experienced O
some O
dizziness B-ADR
and O
some O
nausea B-ADR
and O
some O
serious O
period B-ADR
like I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
at O
work O
, O
so O
I O
just O
had O
to O
brush O
it O
off O
. O
It O
continued O
each O
time O
I O
took O
it O
. O
After O
about O
two O
days O
( O
two O
doses O
) O
, O
the O
cramps B-ADR
continued O
and O
began O
inhibiting B-ADR
my I-ADR
menstrual I-ADR
cycle I-ADR
( O
which O
I O
was O
due O
to O
start O
) O
. O
So O
, O
I O
googled O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
, O
came O
across O
this O
site O
, O
and O
realized O
I O
was O
n't O
the O
only O
one O
with O
those O
side O
effects O
, O
so O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
better O
about O
it O
. O
On O
the O
evening O
of O
4/30 O
, O
I O
suddenly O
got O
some O
serious O
chest B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
an O
elevated B-ADR
heart I-ADR
rate I-ADR
( O
I O
was O
laying O
down O
with O

this O
was O
similar O

, O
hot B-ADR

sever B-ADR
stomach I-ADR

, O
and O
weakness B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
I O
literally O
thought B-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
dying I-ADR
. O
It O
passed O
within O
45 O
minutes O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
go O
to O
work O
the O
next O
day O
. O
At O
work O
( O
5/1 O
) O
, O
I O
was O
sitting O
at O
my O
desk O
and O
the O
same O
thing O
happened O
. O
I O
stepped O
out O
to O
get O
some O
air O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
. O
A O
friend O
at O
work O
had O
to O
call O
an O
ambulance O
. O
I O
was O
filled O
in O
by O
the O
ER O
doc O
that O
the O
mixture O
of O
Cipher O
and O
Arthritic O
was O
insane O
and O
that O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
keep O
from O
cracking O
up O
at O
my O
primary O
doc O
's O
decision O
to O
combine O
them O
. O

Severe B-ADR

Was O
in O

for O
7 O
months O
. O
No O
relief O
from O
any O

Ice O
gave O
some O
relief O
. O
Fatigued B-ADR

by O
end O
of O

. O
Worse O
when O
changed O
to O
Pravachol- O
this O
made O
all O
joints B-DIS
, I-DIS
muscles I-DIS
and I-DIS
tendons I-DIS
hurt I-DIS
all O
over O
my O
body- O
that O
's O
how O
I O
learned O
it O
was O
the O
statins O
causing O
my O
problem- O
doctor O
still O
does O
n't O
believe O
me O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
instantly O
improve O
with O
stopping O
the O
meds O
either O
, O
even O
though O
doctors O
may O
say O
it O
will O
after O
1 O
month O
. O
It O
takes O
at O
least O
3 O
+ O
months O
for O
the O
drug O
to O
get O
out O
of O
your O
system O
according O
to O
pharmacists- O
but O
you O
still O
may O
have O
pain B-ADR
that O
continues O
after O
that O
. O
I O
recommend O
the O
website O
spaced.net O
for O
lots O
of O
info O
, O
recommended O
supplements O
, O
and O
help O
on O
this O
. O
Recently O
discovered O
that O
completely O
avoiding O
all O
caffeine O
and O
alcohol O
and O
just O
drinking O
water O
during O
the O
day O
helps O
the O
pain B-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
and O
weakness B-ADR
diminish O
significantly O
. O
Also O
, O
warm O
showers O
help O
as O
does O
walking O
( O
if O
your O
legs O
do O
n't O
hurt O
) O

Well O
after O
3 O

I O
consulted O

with O
throat B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
Make O
a O
very O
long O
story O
short O
. O
After O
3 O
days O

3 O
esofogual B-ADR
ulcers I-ADR
. O
Also O
could B-ADR
n't I-ADR
eat I-ADR
or I-ADR
drink I-ADR
for O
over O
a O
week O
which O
is O
n't O
pretty O

It O

3 O

I O
still O
ca B-ADR
n't I-ADR
eat I-ADR
normal I-ADR
. O
I O
' O
m O
always O
sick B-DIS
. O

I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor O
after O
my O
cholesterol B-DIS
climbed I-DIS
to O
310 O
. O
I O
Did O
not O
want O
to O
take O
it O
because O
I O
am O
a O
vegetarian O
, O
a O
health O
conscious O
person O
and O
dislike O
taking O
medicines O
, O
but O
my O
doctor O
, O
an O
endocrinologist O
, O
strongly O
recommended O
it O
. O
The O
first O
few O
months O
I O
was O
not O
aware O
of O
any O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
I O
started O
to O
experience O
wrist B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
my O
pilates O
class O
, O
but O
although O
I O
rested O
for O
2 O
months O
from O
the O
class O
, O
the O
pain B-ADR
continued O
. O
Then O
about O
two O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
got O
very O
bad O
cramps B-ADR
in O
my O
toes O
, O
they O
curled O
down O
and O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
terrible O
. O
About O
a O
week O
ago O
I O
was O
taking O
a O
bath O
and O
my O
muscles B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
lower I-ADR
abdomen I-ADR
started I-ADR
to I-ADR
contract I-ADR
then I-ADR
the I-ADR
cramp I-ADR
got O
higher O
. O
I O
got O
scared O
that O
I O
was O
having O
something O
bad O
. O
After O
the O
cramps B-ADR
one O
night O
I O
had O
such O
tiredness B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
leg I-ADR
that O
I O
could B-ADR
hardly I-ADR
walk I-ADR
, O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
my O
high O
heels O
that O
I O
had O
worn O
all O
day O
. O
Then O
2 O
days O
ago O
I O
woke O
up O
with O
a O
swollen B-ADR
foot I-ADR
, O
it O
was O
very O
painful B-ADR
to I-ADR
walk I-ADR
. O
That O
was O
it O
. O
I O
suspected O
that O
it O
was O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
came O
to O
the O
internet O
and O
read O
the O
same O
side O
effects O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
posting O
their O
experiences O
with O
this O
drug O
. O
I O
even O
thought O
that O
I O
had O
ALS B-DIS
since O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
died O
of O
it O
. O
It O
is O
amazing O
the O
amount O
of O
people O
that O
also O
thought O
the O
same O
in O
this O
list O
. O
Thanks O
God O
for O
the O
Internet O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
this O
medicine O
2 O
days O
ago O
, O
I O
hope O
that O
I O
can O
get O
rid O
of O
these O
effects O
and O
that O
they O
are O
not O
permanent O
. O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
it O
, O
unless O
it O
is O
life O
threatening O
and O
then O
only O
take O
it O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

i O
was O
prescribed O
arthritic O
75 O
to O
take O
twice O
a O
day O
with O
or O
before O
food O
. O
i O
took O
the O
very O
first O
tablet O
as O
directed O
, O
two O
hours O
later O
i O
was O
doubled O
up O
in O
pain B-ADR
with I-ADR
stomach I-ADR

, O
i O

two O

, O
wore O
a O
brace O
for O
months O
, O
just O
to O
mention O
a O
few O
of O
the O
problems O
I O
had O
on O
all O
Statins O
. O
Doctors O
left O
me O
on O
Statins O
for O
seven O
years O
. O
My O
advise O
is O
not O
to O
go O
on O
any O
Statins O
I O
still O
hurt O
after O
2 O
years O
off O
them O
. O

If O
I O
take O
the O
pill O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
I O
get O
a O
very O
faint O
sensation O
of O
queasiness B-ADR
. O
almost O
to O
faint O
to O
notice O
. O
However O
, O
I O
also O
get O
diarrhoea B-ADR
at O
least O
twice O
a O
day O
. O
There O
are O
no O
gas B-ADR
pains I-ADR
and O
no O
other O
symptoms O
, O
so O
it O
's O
inconvenient O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O
When O
I O
am O
on O
holiday O
at O
the O
coast O
I O
am O
pain B-DIS
free O
, O
mostly O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
take O
any O
Arthritic O
, O
but O
when O
I O
get O
back O
to O
a O
drier O
climate O
the O
pain B-DIS
is I-DIS
severe I-DIS
, O
so O
Arthritic O
is O
very O
important O
to O
me O
and O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
It O
also O
allows O
me O
to O
sleep O
. O

After O
2 O
months O
being O
on O
Lipitor O
I O
experienced O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
loss B-ADR
of I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
in I-ADR
left I-ADR

. O
Advice O
from O
Cardiologist O
was O
to O
immediately O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
It O
was O
too O
late O
, O
resulting O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
being O
able O
to O
work O
and O
ended O
up O
disability O
and O
would O
like O
to O
join O
a O
class O
action O
lawsuit O
against O
the O
drug O
company O
responsible O
. O
Would O
like O
to O
hear O
from O
others O
who O
have O
had O
problems O
with O
this O
drug O
. O

A O
good O
side O
effect O
- O
I O
take O
the O
lipitor O
at O

because O
my O

. O
right O
away O
I O
was O
falling O

peel O
. O
I O
attribute O
all O
the O
negatives O
to O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
The O
worst O
of O
all O
the O
side O
effects O
is O
the O
horrible O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
feet O
( O
I O
have O
professionally O
prescribed O
orthotics O
in O
my O
shoes O
at O
all O
times O
) O
. O

Took O
away O
all O
my O
hip B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
Had O
very O
bad B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
heavy B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
even O
thought O
my O
period O
was O
n't O
due O
for O
3 O
more O
weeks O
been O
off O
this O
pill O
for O
two O
days O
now O
and O
still O
feeling O
same O
hoping O
cramps B-ADR
stop O
soon O
ca O
n't O
stand O
feeling B-ADR
sick I-ADR
all O
day O
. O

I O
gradually O
lost O
my O
. O
This O
drug O
did O
amazing O
things O
with O
my O
cholesterol O
levels O
, O
it O
reduced O
it O
from O
( O
Australian O
standards O
) O
7.5 O
to O
1.9 O
( O
generally O
considered O
OK O
level O
is O
5.4 O
) O
. O
However O
I O
gradually O
noticed O
that O
during O
the O
day O
I O
would O
get O
very B-ADR
tired I-ADR
, O
and O
have O
to O
sleep O
, O
and O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
driving O
for O
work O
, O
and O
also O
my O
in O
sex B-ADR
drive I-ADR
became I-ADR
non I-ADR
-existant I-ADR
( O
I`m O
also O
told O
very O
low O
levels O
of O
cholesterol O
levels O
does O
this O
) O
. O
Had O
numerous O
odd O
aches B-ADR
, O
especially O
in O
the O
leg O
area O
. O
Discontinued O
this O
drug O
because O
of O
the O
tiredness B-ADR
factor O
. O
Felt O
great O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
without O
it O
. O

Definitely O
short B-ADR
term I-ADR
memory I-ADR
issues I-ADR
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
44 O
and O
I O
suppose O
it O
could O
be O
part O
of O
menopause B-DIS
on O
its O
way O
. O
lowered O
overall O
cholesterol O
and O
my O
hdl O
went O
up O
to O
59 O
from O
35 O
, O
and O
triglycerides O
went O
down O
but O
not O
enough O
. O
LDL O
down O
too O
but O
not O
enough O
so O
taking O
higher O
dose O
now O
. O
Worked O
like O
a O
champ O
at O
10 O
mg O
for O
first O
two O
years O
. O
Now O
switched O
from O
GP O
to O
cardiologist O
and O
he O
's O
upped O
it O
to O
40 O
mg O
so O
will O
see O
. O
have O
only O
taken O
3 O
tablets O
since O
new O
dosage O
. O

Very O
drowsy B-ADR
and O
tired B-ADR
and O
no O
pain B-DIS
relief O
at O
all O
. O
Unlike O
previously O
taking O
just O
one O
tablet O
of O
Aleve O
, O
which O
immediately O
took O
away O
my O
pain B-DIS
symptoms O
, O
this O
drug O
had O
absolutely O
no O
effect O
at O
all O
. O
My O
doctor O
prescribed O
this O
drug O
( O
instead O
of O
Aleve O
) O
, O
to O
be O
taken O
twice O
daily O
, O
but O
after O
reading O
the O
side O
effects O
, O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
that O
frequency O
. O
I O
'll O
not O
bother O
with O
it O
anymore O
and O
will O
occasionally O
take O
Aleve O
instead O
. O
Fortunately O
my O
pharmacy O
made O
an O
error O
in O
only O
giving O
me O
6 O
tablets O
instead O
of O
60 O
. O
I O
' O
m O
glad O
it O
happened O
; O
it O
saved O
me O
an O
unnecessary O
expense O
. O

Second O
time O

First O
time O
I O

Personally O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
are O
worth O
it O
after O
that O
scary O
experience!. O

I O
had O
a O
chronic B-ADR
backache I-ADR
that O
kept O
getting O
worse O
. O
I O
complained O
about O
this O
for O
some O
time O
finally O
a O
doctor O
scheduled O
me O
for O
a O
MRI O
. O
The O
results O
indicated O
I O
have O
arthritis B-DIS
so O
I O
accepted O
that O
and O
attributed O
the O
aches O
to O
simply O
getting O
old O
, O
( O
69 O
yrs O
) O
. O
Two O
weeks O
ago O
it O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
stopped O
my O
regular O
exercise O
. O
About O
a O
week O
ago O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
after O
taking O
my O
usual O
Lipitor O
dose O
, O
while O
making O
my O
nightly O
trip O
to O
the O
toilet O
, O
a O
severe B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
back I-ADR
cramp I-ADR
almost O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
floor O
. O
After O
finishing O
my O
business O
, O
I O
hardly O
could O
sleep O
that O
night O
. O
As O
I O
got O
out O
of O
bed O
that O
morning O
I O
started O
getting O
severe B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
spasms I-ADR
in O
the O
same O
old O
place O
. O
The O
spasms B-ADR
lasted O
most O
of O
the O
day O
and O
gradually O
the O
intensity O
, O
frequency O
and O
duration O
diminished O
. O
Since O
I O
had O
done O
nothing O
recently O
to O
cause O
a O
cramp B-DIS
or O
spasm B-DIS
, O
and O
realizing O
that O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
back B-ADR
aches I-ADR
usually O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
the O
morning O
but O
got O
better O
during O
the O
day O
and O
best O
at O
night O
just O
before O
my O
Lipitor O
dose O
, O
I O
suspected O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
quit O
them O
7 O
days O
ago O
and O
my O
back O
has O
not O
been O
this O
good O
in O
months!. O

I O
took O
one O
dose O
and O
15 O
minutes O
later O
i O
felt O
dizzy B-ADR
and O
had O
chest B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
felt O
like B-ADR
my I-ADR
life I-ADR
was I-ADR
gon I-ADR
na I-ADR
slip I-ADR
away I-ADR
and I-ADR
die I-ADR
. O
i O

severn B-ADR
calf I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
after O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
on O
Lipitor O
where O
I O
could O
early B-ADR
walk I-ADR
and O
after O
talking O
to O
a O

he O
told O
me O
he O
was O
prescribed O
Lipitor O
and O
had O
developed O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
his O
doctor O
switched O

. O
Before O

I O
never O
have O

. O
I O
then O
called O
my O
doctor O
and O
told O
him O
about O
my O

and O
told O
me O
to O
stop O

After O

I O
still O
have O
severn B-ADR
leg I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
went O
in O
for O
another O
doctors O
visit O
and O
he O
said O
he O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
a O
Lipitor O
side O
effect O
because O
the O
cramps B-ADR
were O
localized O
and O
felt O
maybe O
the O
cramps B-ADR
were O
caused O
by O
a O
muscle B-DIS
sneeze I-DIS
. O
He O
drew O
blood O
and O
is O
running O

. O
About O
the O

time O
I O
got O
the O
leg B-ADR

my O
right B-ADR
knee I-ADR
swelled I-ADR
up O
so O
I O
saw O
another O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
the O
knee O
and O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
are O
related O
side O
effects O
. O
Anyway O
I O
asked O
the O
second O
doctor O
about O
Lipitor O
side O
effects O
re O
. O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
he O
felt O
that O
the O
side O
effect O
could O
be O
localized O
and O
that O
the O
cramps B-ADR
could O
. O
After O
learning O
about O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
Lipitor O

there O

a O
prostate B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
patient O

take O
a O
number O

raise O
the O

Apparently O
, O
some O
( O
a O
few O
) O
patients O
can O
not O
tolerate O
this O
drug O
. O
I O
note O
that O
there O
are O
some O
on O
this O
list O
who O
have O
permanent O
damage O
, O
so O
it O
is O
serious O
for O
some O
of O
us O

My O
legs B-ADR
are I-ADR
still I-ADR
sore I-ADR

feel O
worse O
than O
they O
did O
after O
a O
day O
of O
agressive O
downhill O
skiing O
a O
week O
ago O
. O
Apparently O
this O
works O
for O
most O
, O
but O
some O
people O
have O
a O
severe O
and O
not O
so O
obvious O
reaction O
. O
Stop O
immediately O
if O
there O
is O
any O
muscle B-DIS

I O

I O
'll O
take O

I O

Severe B-ADR
leg I-ADR

leg B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
which O
started O
gradually O
and O
within O
four O
weeks O
interfered O
with O
my O

because O
of O
calf B-ADR
muscle I-ADR

. O
I O
have O
been O
informed O
by O
my O
doctor O
that O
my O
LDL O
was O
much O
improved O
over O
the O
short O
period O
while O
I O
was O
on O
the O
drug O
. O
However O
, O
this O
drug O
has O
caused O
a O
major O
change O
in O
my O
life O
style O

Although O
I O
stopped O
this O
drug O
three O
months O
ago O
and O
I O
was O
assured O
the O
leg B-ADR
pain I-ADR
would O
resolve O
, O
I O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
function O
because O
of O
the O
continuous O
leg B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
discomfort B-ADR
. O
I O
was O
on O
10 O
mg O
a O
day O
and O
was O
informed O
that O
this O
was O
a O
low O
dose O
. O
The O
result O
of O
taking O
this O
drug O
has O
seriously O
impaired B-ADR
my I-ADR
ability I-ADR
to I-ADR
take I-ADR
long I-ADR
walks I-ADR
or I-ADR
exercise I-ADR
in O
general O
since O

up O
. O
Although O
I O
have O
been O
assured O
that O
this O
will O
resolve O
, O
I O
have O
been O
off O

have O
only O
experienced O
a O

At O
each O

would O
tell O
him O
my O

mention O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
the O
Lipitor O
, O
He O
would O
always O
say O
no O
way O
and O
I O
need O
to O
continue O
the O

My O

A O
few O
years O
after O
the O
dosage O
was O
raised O
to O
40 O
mg O
, O
I O
began O
to O
have O
a O
sharp B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
ball I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
right I-ADR
foot I-ADR
, O
diagnosed O
as O
a O
neuroma B-DIS
. O
( O
It O
seemed O
more O
like O
metatarsalgia B-DIS
to O
me O
. O
) O
Then O
the O
left B-ADR
foot I-ADR
started I-ADR
hurting I-ADR
also O
. O
I O
nearly O
stopped O
walking O
for O
6 O
months O
, O
hoping O
to O
get O
better O
to O
avoid O
surgery O
. O
I O
stopped O
Lipitor O
as O
an O
experiment O
, O
and O
after O
3 O
days O
the O
pain B-ADR
changed O
completely O
. O
It O
began O
to O
heal O
after O
that O
. O
Every O
week O
since O
has O
been O
a O
marked O
improvement O
. O
After O
7 O
weeks O
, O
it O
's O
nearly O
healed O
. O
I O
can O
again O
hike O
for O
miles O
without O
the O
horrible B-ADR
pain I-ADR
I O
experienced O
for O
over O
6 O
months O
while O
taking O
this O
drug O
. O
Lipitor O
did O
control O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
is O
n't O
it O
really O
inflamation B-DIS
causing O
heart B-DIS
disease I-DIS
and O
stroke B-DIS
, O
and O
not O
the O
cholesterol O
? O
Is O
everyone O
barking O
up O
the O
wrong O
tree O
here O
? O
And O
what O
is O
the O
price O
of O
all O
the O
weird O
side O
effects O
no O
one O
can O
recognize O
? O
. O

Sudden O
, O
very O
severe B-ADR
urinary I-ADR
tract I-ADR
infections I-ADR
. O
It O
took O
me O
8 O
years O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
I O
was O
getting O
these O
very O
sudden O
and O
very O
severe B-ADR
infections I-ADR
every O
3 O
- O
5 O
months O
. O
when O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
the O
infections B-ADR
stopped O
, O
too O
. O

None O
Maybe O
I O
' O
m O
just O
lucky O
. O
I O
went O
from O
80 O
mg O
zocor O
to O
40 O
then O
80 O
mg O
lipitor O
all O
with O
no O
discernible O
side O
effects O
. O
Without O
statins O
my O
TC O
is O
around O
300 O
, O
with O
80 O
mgm O
lipitor O
it O
is O
a O
consistent O
140 O
. O
Nothing O
else O
worked O
to O
bring O
it O
down O
and O
I O
nearly O
died O
with O
99 O
% O
blockage B-DIS
of I-DIS
the I-DIS
LAD I-DIS
before O
an O
angioplasty O
and O
going O
on O
statins O
. O
Both O
my O
grandfather O
and O
father O
dropped O
dead O
in O
their O
early O
sixties O
. O
For O
me O
, O
this O
is O
a O
wonder O
drug O
. O

Terrific O
cramps B-ADR
in I-ADR
legs I-ADR
and O
awful O
gas B-ADR
pains I-ADR
in I-ADR
abdomen I-ADR
and I-ADR
back I-ADR
for O
the O
last O
month O
at O
least O
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
LDL O
( O
not O
enough O
) O
but O
also O
lowered O
my O
HDL O
as O
well O
! O
! O
The O
ratio O
is O
not O
good!. O
I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor O
about O
3 O
yrs O
. O
ago O
. O
I O
started O
at O
20 O
. O
then O
my O
Dr O
doubled O
it O
to O
40 O
and O
kept O
wanting O
me O
to O
double O
it O
again O
to O
80 O
. O
After O
me O
telling O
him O
for O
months O
I O
would O
not O
do O
this O
. O
I O
gave O
it O
( O
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
) O
but O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
60 O
rather O
than O
80 O
. O
Well O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
after O
taking O
this O
increased O
dosage O
for O
about O
two O
months O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
such O
gas B-ADR
pains I-ADR
around I-ADR
my I-ADR
abdomen I-ADR
and I-ADR
my I-ADR
back I-ADR
and O
also O
leg B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
I O
finally O
went O
to O
see O
a O
Dr O
in O
Urgent O
Care O
as O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
so O
severe O
. O
He O
examined O
me O
and O
could O
not O
find O
any O
swellings O
etc O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
done O
anything O
different O
with O
my O
meds O
. O
I O
told O
him O
I O
had O
increased O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
he O
suggested O
that O
I O
stop O
taking O
it O
ASAP O
. O
I O
only O
stopped O
taking O
it O
last O
night O
and O
I O
am O
anticipating O
that O
I O
will O
feel O
better O
( O
I O
like O
to O
be O
physical O
and O
do O
lots O
of O
walking O
) O
. O
I O
tried O
Crestor O
a O
little O
while O
ago O
and O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Dept O
. O
of O
a O
hospital O
here O
with O
heart O
palpations O
. O
I O
' O
m O
not O
really O
very O
confident O
in O
these O
STATINS O
! O
! O
! O
I O
honestly O
feel O
they O
are O
dangerous O
and O
am O
going O
to O
try O
a O
natural O
product O
in O
the O
future O
. O
Thank O
God O
for O
a O
Dr O
that O
finally O
told O
me O
to O
STOP!. O

only O
took O
1 O
tab O
once O
a O
day O
for O
two O
days O

I O
found O
that O
Voltaren O
took O
away O
all O
my O

i O
rarely O
use O

because O
i O
find O
it O
never O

takes O

long O

just O
"""" O

As O
i O
am O
only O
young O

healthy O
i O
did O
not O
experience O
any O
side O

HOWEVER O
my O
parents O
both O
have O
had O
bad O
side O

so O
i O
do O

recommend O
it O
if O

Otherwise O
if O

you O

cut O
it O

the O
chances O

getting O
side O
effects O
seem O
to O
increase O
according O
to O
the O
length O
of O
time O
you O
continue O
using O
them O
( O
like O
most O
drugs O
) O
and O
the O
effectiveness B-ADR

No O

Doctor O

me O
a O

I O
took O
it O
for O
four O

asked O
for O

In O
four O

, O
my O

dropped O
100 O

though O
not O

With O
my O

at O

, O
I O
declined O
to O
take O
more O
Lipitor O

Got O
HDL O

within O
another O
two O

certain O
over O
-the O

I O
found O
online O
that O
supposedly O
do O
the O
job O

They O
do O
! O
And O
the O
nice O
thing O
is O
, O
if O
my O
cholesterol O
goes O
up O
again O
, O
I O
know O
that O
very O
low O
dose O
of O
Lipitor O
will O
take O

it O

Good O
stuff!. O

I O

on O
Pravachol O
for O
about O
10 O

without O
any O

My O
only O
complaint O
with O

the O
fact O
that O

know O
about O
symptoms O

She O
explained O
that O
drug O
was O
mfg O
in O
USA O
. O
My O
concern O
was O
that O
maybe O
some O
of O
the O
drug O
was O
mfg O
outside O
of O
USA O
, O
like O
maybe O
China O
and O
that O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
formula O
was O
causing O
problems O

But O
in O
general O
the O
whole O
formula O
is O
poison O

I O

needs O

Over O

years O
years O
6 O
- O
8 O
of O
using O

The O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
keeps O
me O
awake O
at O
night O
and O
life O
is O
just O
a O
pain O
, O
but O
I O
must O
point O
out O
I O
am O
not O
feel O
depressed O
about O
it O
at O
all O
. O
I O
just O
get O
on O
with O
life O
and O
try O
to O
manage O
the O
muscle B-ADR
pains I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
today O
a O
bit O
concerned O
after O
being O
feeling O
strange O
for O
about O

by O
strange O
I O
mean O
daily O

so O
I O
when O
to O
see O
the O
doctor O
and O
he O
suggested O
I O
stop O
taking O
the O
med O
. O
Worked O
well O
for O
the O
first O
5 O
years O
but O
cholesterol O
seems O
to O
have O
creeped O
up O
a O
bit O
from O
4.4 O
to O
5.3 O
over O
years O
6 O
, O
7 O
& O
8 O
. O

I O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
the O
first O
two O
days O
. O
The O
doctor O
prescribed O
for O
me O
to O
take O
2 O
per O
day O
and O
I O
' O
m O
very O
glad O
I O
did O
n't O
. O
I O
took O
one O
per O
day O
and O
this O
is O
the O
third O
day O
. O
My O
face B-ADR
has I-ADR
felt I-ADR
numb I-ADR
most O
of O
the O
day O
and O
I O
feel O
light B-ADR
headed I-ADR
. O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
this O
feeling O
off O
, O
which O
has O
not O
been O
fun O
on O
the O
knee O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
suggest O
voltaren O
because O
it O
did O
nothing O
for O
the O
inflammation B-DIS
in O
the O
knee O
and O
has O
me O
in O
a O
panic O
until O
I O
can O
get O

out O
of O
my O
system O
. O

Still O
have O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR

& O
when O
I O
refused O

the O
2nd O
time O
, O
even O

they O
continued O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
I O
could O
DIE O
if O
I O
did O
not O
take O
it O
, O
with O
my O
response O
being O
that O
I O
could O
live O
with O
agonizing O
pain B-DIS
and O
be O
disabled B-DIS
on O
this O
medication O
or O
possibly O
NOT O

Very O
slowly O

over O

, O
trying O
to O
find O
out O
what O
is O
wrong O
with O
me O
. O
I O
JUST O
turned O
40 O
years O
old O
and O
should O
not O
feel O
like O
this O
. O
Out O
of O
nowhere O
, O
I O
heard O
about O
coq10 O
depletion O
and O
just O
started O
the O
supplement O
today O
. O
I O
was O
never O
told O
ANY O
of O
these O
symptoms O
could O
relate O
to O
the O
Lipitor O
- O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
specifically O
asked O
if O
any O
of O
my O
medications O
could O
be O
causing O
these O
problems O
. O

Took O
50 O
mg O
arthritic O
with O
one O
tylenol O
# O

and O
within O
30 O
minutes O
I O
had O
the O
most O
severe B-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
pain I-ADR
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
experienced O
. O
It O
was O
more O
like O
bowel B-ADR
/uterine I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
. O
It O
was O
so O
severe O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O
I O
had O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
already O
for O
my O

, O
was O
given O
a O
prescription O
and O
never O
told O
of O
these O

I O
then O
spent O
the O
night O
back O
in O
the O
ER O
for O
the O
severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
The O
doctor O
thought O
it O
was O
likely O
the O
codeine O
in O
the O
tylenol O
# O
3 O
but O
after O
reading O
all O
these O
comments O
, O
I O
doubt O

very O
much O

Will O
never O

Who O
would O

such O

drug O
can O
do O
so O
much O
harm O
and O
is O
recommended O
by O
the O
family O
doctor O

It O
does O
lower O

it O
also O
is O
a O

In O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
its O
the O
LIPITOR O
that O
is O
doing O
it O
. O
My O
doctor O
only O
increased O
my O
dosage O
to O
60 O
from O
40 O
about O
3 O
months O
ago O
. O
can O
we O
quit O
this O
med O
cold O
turkey O
? O
I O
have O
had O
a O
Myocardial B-DIS
Infarction I-DIS
in O
' O
98 O
, O
have O
2 O
stents O

, O
and O
need O
the O
med O
to O
keep O
my O
chol O
at O
least O
within O
reason O
, O
although O
obviously O
its O
NOT O
doing O
its O
job O
, O
or O
med O
would O
not O
have O
been O
increased O
. O

Lipitor O
reduced O
my O
readings O
to O
almost O
normal O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
I O
suffered O
from O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
all I-ADR
over I-ADR
my I-ADR
body I-ADR
got O
worse O
as O
time O
went O
on O
. O
I O
noticed O
that O
when O
I O
left O
my O
Lipitor O
at O
home O
when O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
or O
other O
trip O
, O
that O
I O
began O
to O
feel O
better O
. O
My O
doctor O
told O
me O
there O
was O
a O
remote O
possibility O
that O
the O
Lipitor O
was O
aggravating O
the O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
and O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
! O
But O
, O
it O
seems O
I O
buggered O
up O
my O
stomach O
from O
all O
the O
pain O
killers O
that O
I O
took O
. O
What O
to O
do O
next O
? O
. O
Please O
be O
carefull O
with O
this O
drug O
and O
watch O
for O
all O
types O
of O
body B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
. O

muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
thighs O
and O
legs O
. O
Off O
for O
6 O
weeks O
with O
no O
improvement O
. O
I O
' O
m O
afraid O
it O
may O
be O
permanent O
. O
CPT O
test O
slightly O
elevated O
. O

Possibly O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
but O
most O
likely O
none O
because O
I O
am O
taking O
this O
with O
a O
nasty O
antibiotic O
for O
a O
sinus B-DIS
infection I-DIS
that O
definitely O
causes O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
nausea B-ADR
. O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
take O
it O
2x O
/day O
for O
7 O
days O
and O
then O
2x O
/day O
as O
needed O
. O
I O
completed O
the O
7 O
days O
and O
then O
did O
not O
take O
it O
on O
the O
8th O
day O
. O
The O
pain B-DIS
was O
immediately O
worse O
than O
before O
taking O
Voltaren O
. O
It O
does O
help O
the O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
knee I-DIS
, O
which O
is O
a O
strained B-DIS
meniscus I-DIS
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
afraid O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
masking O
the O
pain B-DIS
which O
enables O
me O
to O
overexert O
my O
joints O
and O
cause O
more O
injury O
. O
This O
really O
makes O
me O
nervous O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
speak O
with O
my O
doctor O
about O
this O
possibility O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Lipitor O
40 O
mg O
. O
for O
2 O
years O
. O
GREAT O
results O

I O

The O

I O
was O
down O
to O
a O
level O
4 O
and O
now O
hitting O
10 O
for O
parts O
of O
each O
day O
. O
I O
told O
the O
dr O
. O
I O
felt I-ADR
socked I-ADR
in I-ADR
the O
arm O
, O
he O
thinks O
my I-DIS
chronic I-DIS
problem O
is O
just O
getting O
worse O
. O
I O
hope O
he O
is O
wrong O
because O
I O
can O
not O
take O
this O
much O
longer O
. O

Horrific O
medication O
- O
Suffered O
an O
acute B-ADR
pancreatic I-ADR
attack I-ADR
with O
critical B-ADR
blood I-ADR
levels I-ADR
that O
almost O
caused O
my O
death O
. O
My O
entire O
body B-ADR
was I-ADR
"""" I-ADR
shutting I-ADR
"""" I-ADR
down I-ADR
. O
My O
blood O
reports O
were O
at O
critical O
levels O
, O
BP B-ADR
was I-ADR
very I-ADR
low I-ADR
98/60 O
, O

for O
over O
6 O
weeks O
, O

Then O
the O
doctor O
in O
charge O
left O
us O
floundering O
on O
our O
own O
, O
going O
from O
one O
specialist O
after O
another O
to O
counter O
what O
was O
happening O
. O
My O
children O
did O
some O
research O
on O
the O
web O
about O
my O
drugs O
that O
I O
was O
taking O
, O
which O
included O
Voltaren O
, O
and O
learned O
about O
the O
adverse O
reactions O
to O
this O
drug O
and O
I O
stopped O
Voltaren O
. O
The O
specialists O
agreed O
with O
this O
conclusion O
, O
since O
they O
were O
exact O
to O
my O
problems O
. O
My O
body O
reacted O
and O
I O
recovered O
gradually O
. O
My O
advice O
to O
all O
- O
STOP O
- O
Find O
something O
else O
. O
I O
lost O
2 O
months O

I O
still O

remember B-ADR
the I-ADR
entire I-ADR
e. O
If O
you O
are O
taking O
this O
drug O
- O
Make O
absolutely O
sure O
that O
you O
get O

done O
every O
6 O
months O
, O
in O
order O
to O
catch O
any O
critical O
levels O
in O
your O
blood O
. O
Then O
- O
STOP O
- O
the O
drug O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
noticed O
severe B-ADR

. O
I O
put O
this O
off O
as O
a O
work O
-out O
related O
pain B-ADR
. O
After O
the O
pain B-ADR
intensified O
after O
it O
should O
have O
gone O
away O
, O
I O
became O
concerned O
. O
Then O
I O
noticed O
that O
my O
knee B-ADR
and I-ADR
my I-ADR
right I-ADR
hip I-ADR
hurt I-ADR
. O
Then O
I O
started O
crying B-ADR
for I-ADR
no I-ADR
reason I-ADR
. O
I O
yelled O
at O
my O
poor O
dog O
for O
doing O
nothing O
. O
all O
in O
all O
, O
this O
drug O
really O
sucks O
. O
I O
hate O
it O
. O
I O
hate O
the O
doctor O
that O
put O
me O
on O
it O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
get O
off O
of O
it O
. O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
been O
on O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
I O
swear O
she O
must O
be O
doing O
it O
for O
the O
drug O
compact O
kick O
backs O
. O

Hell O
on O
earth O
. O
Took O
10 O

what O
I O
think O
, O
It O
's O
dangerous O
stuff O
. O
Will O
never O
touch O
this O
junk O
again O
. O
Asked O
my O
pharmacist O
about O
all O
the O
pain B-ADR
especially I-ADR
back I-ADR
, O
he O
said O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
the O
Lipitor O
! O
Really O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
take O
a O
blood O
test O
but O
, O
the O
results O
will O
have O
no O
bearing O
on O
my O
decision O
. O
No O
Lipitor O
, O
there O
is O
something O
very O
wrong O
with O
it O
. O
I O
' O
m O
only O
40 O
yrs O
old O
and O
I O
felt O
like O
90 O
, O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
death O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
move O
because O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
, O
could O
n't O
sleep O
or O
woke O
up O
at O
11 O
am O
and O
could O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
made O
very O
irrational O
moves O
while O
driving O
, O
could B-ADR
n't I-ADR
remember I-ADR
where I-ADR
I I-ADR
left I-ADR
my I-ADR
dog I-ADR
10 I-ADR
minutes I-ADR
before I-ADR
or I-ADR
who I-ADR
I I-ADR
had I-ADR

2 O

While O
this O
helped O
some O
with O
the O

, O
I O
was O
unpleasantly O
surprised O
at O
the O

of I-ADR
my I-ADR

plus O
the O

so O
my O

this O

I O
' O
m O
not O
taking O
any O

Never O

before O

about O

Certainly O
nothing O
I O
ca O

live O
with O

it O
worsens O
and O
after O
10 O

I O
doubt O
that O

on O

Terrible B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
hips I-ADR
and I-ADR
shoulders I-ADR
. O
After O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
year O
, O
I O
started O
having O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
hip I-ADR
. O
Told O
Dr O
about O
it O
, O
he O
did O
n't O
seem O
to O
concerned O
. O
After O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
I O
started O
having O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
shoulders I-ADR
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
is I-ADR
so I-ADR
bad I-ADR
at O
this O
point O
that O
it O
wakes O
me O
up O
at O
night O
and O
extremely B-ADR
limits I-ADR
the I-ADR
use I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
. O
Dr O
sent O
me O
for O
x O
-rays O
, O
MRI O
, O
to O
see O
an O
orthopedic O
surgeon O
. O
All O
results O
negative O
. O
They O
suggested O
it O
could O
be O
tendonitis B-DIS
or O
avascular B-DIS
necrosis I-DIS
and O
recommended O
anti O
-inflammatories O
. O
Nobody O
ever O
suggested O
it O
could O
be O
the O
drug O
until O
I O
found O
this O
site O
doing O
research O
on O
my O
pain B-ADR
. O
It O
makes O
me O
wonder O
how O
powerful O
these O
drug O
companies O
are O
that O
doctors O
wo O
n't O
even O
suggest O
that O
the O
drug O
could O
be O
the O
problem O
. O
I O
' O
m O
stopping O
this O
drug O
today O
in O
the O
hopes O
that O
the O
pain B-ADR
goes O
away O
. O
Hopefully O
I O
'll O
be O
able O
to O
play O
catch O
with O
my O
boys O
and O
swing O
a O
golf O
club O
again O
some O
day O

If O
I O
die O
of O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
from O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
in O
20 O
years O
, O
so O
be O
it O
. O
I O
'd O
rather O
have O
a O
shorter O
life O
that O
I O
enjoy O
than O
a O
long O
life O
of O
pain B-DIS

then O

before O
the O
Doctor O
saw O
any O

but O
as O
the O
milligrams O
went O
up O
i O
got O
more O
& O
more O
symptoms O
, O
and O
i O
had O
even O
left O
my O

I O

i O
did O

even O

My O

began O
to O
have O
symptoms B-ADR
of I-ADR
als I-ADR
shortly O
after O
her O
lipitor O
dose O
was O

She O
was O

a O
half O
after O
that O
. O
I O
lost O
my O
mother O
on O
January O

, O
2008 O
. O
I O
want O
to O
know O
if O
lipitor O
is O
connected O
to O
als B-ADR
. O
My O
husband O
was O
on O
it O
for O
less O
than O
6 O
months O
and O
he O
noticed O
leg B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
neck B-ADR

, O
trouble B-ADR
swallowing I-ADR
and O
more O
. O

Other O
than O
mild B-ADR
flatulence I-ADR
and O
things O
of O
this O
nature O
, O
I O
did O
not O
connect O
Lipitor O
to O
the O
terrible O
low B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
I O
have O
had O
for O
about O
5 O
months O
. O
but O
after O
reading O
comments O
on O
this O
website O
, O
I O
am O
wondering O
about O
this O
back B-ADR
and I-ADR
neck I-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
worsens O
. O
It O
is O
a O
miracle O
drug O
along O
with O
Vitamin O
E O
and O
additional O
Premarin O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
was O
over O
600 O
a O
number O
of O
years O
back O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
tried O
at O
least O
5 O
other O
meds O
for O
this O
condition O
but O
this O
one O
is O
most O
effective O
. O
The O
lowest O
the O
other O
ones O
took O
it O
was O
to O
300 O
. O
My O
endocrinologist O
thought O
this O
was O
going O
to O
be O
the O
best O
it O
could O
be O
controlled O
. O
So O
, O
I O
really O
believe O
in O
this O
drug O
, O
but O
must O
consider O
what O
it O
may O
be O
doing O
to O
my O
body O
and O
my O
degree O
of O
pain B-ADR
. O
I O
have O
taken O
Lipitor O
since O
it O
was O
approved O
4 O
or O

years O

. O
If O
anyone O
has O
any O
experience O
like O
mine O

please O

in I-DIS
the I-DIS
other I-DIS
shoulder I-DIS
, I-DIS
elbow I-DIS
, I-DIS
and I-DIS
knee I-DIS
, O
but O
moved O
and O
had O
to O
get O
another O

. O
In O
the O
meantime O
I O
was O
off O
the O

for O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
saw O
improvement O
of O
those O
areas O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
been O
back O

another O
6 O
months O

terribly I-ADR
painful I-ADR
. O
I O
have O
stopped O
the O

for O
a O
week O
and O
hope O
to O

soon O
. O
Diet O
and O
exercise O
does O
not O
work O
for O
my O
genetic O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
, O
but O
I O
am O
with O
the O
majority O
here O
and O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
it O
if O
ending O
up O
crippled B-DIS

senile B-DIS

I O
will O
find O
a O
natural O
alternative O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
all O

Have O
ceased O

as O
this O
is O
wholly O
impractical O
, O
given O
my O
loss O
of O

. O
Pain B-ADR
is I-ADR
so I-ADR
intense I-ADR
that O
pain O
killers O
do O
not O
help O
. O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
why O
this O
condition O
should O
come O
on O
so O
suddenly O
. O
It O
started O
with O
a O
flu B-ADR
-like I-ADR
symptoms I-ADR
, O
three O
to O
four O
weeks O
ago O
, O
followed O
by O
pains B-ADR

my I-ADR
left I-ADR
knee I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
presently O
being O
tested O
for O
arthritis B-DIS

but O
there O
is O
no O
history O
of O
arthritis B-DIS
in O
my O
family O
and O
I O
am O
just O
61 O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
has I-ADR
been I-ADR
so I-ADR
intense I-ADR
that O
my O
life O
is O
being O
made O
a O
misery O
. O
Will O
now O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
having O
read O
the O
comments O
on O
this O
site O
and O
hope O
I O
recover O
. O
Assuming O
Lipitor O
is O
the O
culprit O
I O
am O
really O
annoyed O
with O
my O
doctor O
. O
and O
will O
tell O
him O
so O
. O
I O
went O
to O
him O
feeling O
totally O
OK O
nine O
months O
ago O
and O
he O
advised O
me O
to O
start O
taking O
this O
drug O
. O
Better O
to O
live O
ten O
years O
feeling O
OK O
and O
then O
drop O
dead O
of O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
, O
rather O
than O
commit O
suicide O
to O
escape O
the O
intense B-DIS
pain I-DIS
caused O
by O
a O
prescribed O
drug O
. O
. O

I O
am O
experiencing O
lower B-ADR
leg I-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
is O
a O
throbbing B-ADR
, I-ADR
burning I-ADR
sensation I-ADR
. O
Does O
not O
bother O
in O
a.m. O
but O
begins O
mid O
-afternoon O
and O
continues O
into O
evening O
. O
Neurologist O
finds O
no O
nerve O
involvement O
so O
think O
it O
must O
be O
drug O
-related O
. O
Are O
others O
having O
this O
problem O
? O
. O

Severe B-ADR
back I-ADR

on I-ADR
my I-ADR

I O
was O

when O
my O

I O
was O

A O
general O

feeling I-ADR
and O
sitting O
very O

in O
the O
hope O
it O
would O
go O
away O
. O
I O
will O
tolerate O
the O
pain B-DIS
before O
I O
would O
ever O
take O
this O
again O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
had O
any O
side O
effects O
until O
I O
started O
reading O
through O
some O
of O
the O
list O
of O
problems O
other O
people O
are O
having O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
the O

done O
a O
good O

are O
the O

it O

I O

then O

This O

I O
complained O

then O
he O
switched O

then O
switched O

my O

the O

after O

some O

I O
am O
concerned O

The O

me O
extremely B-ADR

I O
could B-ADR

My O
doctor O
had O
me O
try O
it O
although O
my O

was O
only O
205 O

I O
told O
her O
about O
my O
misgivings O

she O
thought O
I O
would O
do O
ok O

it O

I O
even O
questioned O
her O
about O
the O

she O
said O
it O
hardly O

In O
less O
than O
two O
weeks O
I O
was O
so O
hyperactive B-ADR
I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
crazy O
. O
I O
worked O
overnight O
at O
my O
job O
and O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
do O
things O
so O
fast O
that O
I O
would O
frustrate O
myself O
. O
My O
brain O
also O
felt O
like O
it O
was O
kicked O
into O
high O
gear O
as O
if O
I O
was O
on O
constant B-ADR
alert I-ADR
for O
something O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
after O
two O
weeks O
and O
told O
my O
doctor O
. O
She O
said O
if O
it O
was O
the O
Lipitor O
she O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
that O
happening O
to O
anyone O
before O
and O
recommended O
I O
continue O
its O
' O
use O
. O
I O
stopped O
and O
now O
refuse O
to O
use O
it O
. O
At O
my O
last O
physical O
she O
said O
she O
was O
happy O
that O
I O
was O
so O
healthy O

I O

the O

I O

I O
was O
advised O
to O
take O

as O
it O

counter O

I O
will O
to O
have O

because O
I O
simply O
can O
not O
go O
through O
this O
again O

I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
never O
going O

this O

Calf O

( O

This O
often O
leads I-ADR
to I-ADR
leg I-ADR

Comparable O
to O

after O
a O
long O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
Lipitor O

about O
4 B-ADR
yrs I-ADR
- I-ADR
the I-ADR
muscle O
tiring O
has O
become O
worse O

now O
will O
' O
act O
' O
up O
very O
soon O
even O
with O
a O
short O
slow O

. O
This O
has O
severely O
hampered O
my O
ability O
to O
excercise O
. O
I O
first O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
response O
to I-DIS
the O
diabetes O
but O
was O
recently O
made O
aware O
that O
Lipitor O
may O
be O
causing O
it O
. O
Lipitor O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
soon O
after O
starting O
it O
. O
It O
does O
n't O
seem O
as O
effective O
now O
. O
I O
' O
m O
going O
to O
stop O
taking O
it O
because O
of I-ADR
the I-ADR
muscle O
fatigue O
/cramping O
- O
hopefully O
this O
condition O
will O
reverse O

that O
I O
noticed O

I O
did O
take O
my O

today I-ADR
though I-ADR
, I-ADR
and I-ADR
it I-ADR
was I-ADR
slightly I-ADR
elevated I-ADR
from O
the O
norm O
. O
I O
suspect O
the O
drug O
is O
responsible O
, O
but O
as O
I O
am O
only O
taking O
it O
short O
-term O
, O
I O
am O
not O
overly O
concerned O
. O
I O
had O
acute B-DIS
shoulder I-DIS
tendonitis I-DIS
and O
was O
in O
absolute O
agony B-DIS
. O
Within O
24 O
hours O
of O
taking O
this O
medicine O
, O
the O
inflammation B-DIS
was O
reduced O
dramatically O
and O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
improve O
, O
gaining O
back O
more O
of O
my O
range O
of O
motion O
with O
each O
day O
. O

Had O
a O
scary O
experience O
that O
I O
am O
associating O
with O
Voltaren O
. O
Not O
completely O
convinced O
it O
was O
the O
RX O
but O
I O
have O
no O
other O
reason O
for O
the O
reaction O
. O
First O
dosage O
I O
was O
hit O
with O
extreme B-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
issues I-ADR
including O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O
Figured O
it O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
adequate O
food O
on O
board O
when O
I O
took O
the O
1st O
dose O
so O
increased O
my O
meal O
before O
I O
took O
the O
2nd O
dose O
. O
Problem O
solved O
! O
Was O
on O
the O
meds O
for O
7 O
days O
when O
I O
experienced O
chest B-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
and O
upper O
abdominal B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
. O
With O
a O
medical O
background O
, O
I O
know O
that O
cardiac O
symptoms O
are O
mistaken O
for O
gastric O
reasons O
so O
I O
went O
to O
the O
ER O
. O
Long O
story O
short O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
severe O
gastric O
distress O

and O
with O
a O
"""" O
gastric O
cocktail O
"""" O
and O
a O
high O

prilosec O
, O
I O
had O
some O
serious O
relief O
and O
sent O
home O
. O
Not O
convinced O
it O
was O
the O
issue O
, O
I O
went O
a O
day O
without O
the O
RX O
and O
then O
started O
again O
. O
I O
was O
n't O
entirely O
100 O
% O
after O
taking O
the O
dose O
and O
now O
, O
I O
am O
fairly O
certain O
it O
was O
the O
Voltaren O
. O
I O
must O
say O
that O
my O

never O
had O
before O
and O
excused O
as O
stress B-DIS
related O
. O
Nausea B-ADR
and O
vomiting B-ADR
began O
several O
months O
later O
, O
if O
taken O
within O
a O
3 O
-4 O
hours O
of O
eating O
. O
Then O
within O
a O
year O
of O
being O
on O
the O
medication O
, O
I O
experienced O
severe O
facial B-ADR
paralysis I-ADR
diagnosed O
as O
Bell B-DIS
's I-DIS
Palsy I-DIS
. O
Severe O
hip B-ADR
and I-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
followed O
, O
along O
with O
depression B-ADR
, O
thoughts B-ADR
of I-ADR
suicide I-ADR
and O
paranoia B-ADR
. O
The O
overwhelming O
exhaustion B-ADR
that O
I O
felt O
every O
morning O
for O
over O
a O
year O
intensified O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
altering O
when O
I O
take O
Lipitor O
but O
it O
did O
not O
help O
with O
the O
nausea B-ADR
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
45 O
days O
ago O
after O
I O
began O
to O
experience O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
again O
. O
I O
researched O
Lipitor O
in O
a O
pharmacy O
book O
and O
realized O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
, O
along O
with O
most O
of O
my O
other O
ailments O
, O
were O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
started O
noticing O
improvement O
during O
the O
first O
30 O
days O
. O
At O
45 O
days O
, O
my O
facial B-ADR
paralysis I-ADR
is O
99 O
% O
gone O
, O
I O
wake O
rested O
, O
my O
back B-ADR
and I-ADR
hip I-ADR
pain I-ADR
are O
slowly O
improving O
and O
my O
overall O
mental O
wellbeing O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
whatsoever O
. O
Cholesterol O
down O
to O
102 O
. O

Particularly O
diarrhea B-ADR
! O
Many O
unscheduled O
washroom O
stops O
over O
the O
time O
I O
' O
ve O
taken O
this O
medication O
. O
Lately O
ankle B-ADR
swelling I-ADR
and O
lower B-ADR
tendon I-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
was O
not O
experienced O
previously O
. O
Males O
tend O
to O
tolerate O
this O
medication O
better O
than O
women O
from O
my O
observation O
. O
This O
medication O
helped O
get O
me O
back O
to O
work O
and O
achieve O
tolerable O
pain B-DIS
levels O
and O
mobility B-DIS
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
the O
pain B-DIS
returned O
. O
Currently O
take O
one O
75 O
mg O
dose O
2 O
hours O
before O
work O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
enough O
to O
ease O
my O
particular O
condition O
. O
Probably O
alright O
for O
otherwise O
healthy O
individuals O
but O
those O
with O
other O
medical O
problems O
should O
probably O
avoid O
it O
. O
It O
will O
most O
likely O
exacerbate O
there O
ill O
health O
with O
unwelcome O
side O
effects O
. O

Swollen B-ADR
and I-ADR
stiff I-ADR
knees I-ADR
and I-ADR
elbows I-ADR
, O
mental B-ADR
distress I-ADR
, O
others O
that O
I O
am O
now O
only O
becoming O
aware O
of O
after O
reading O
many O
of O
these O
others O
testimonials O
. O
After O
being O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
2 O
years O
my O
knees B-ADR
and I-ADR
elbows I-ADR
were I-ADR
getting I-ADR
increasingly I-ADR
stiff I-ADR
and I-ADR
sore I-ADR
. O
I O
' O
m O
a O
painter O
by O
trade O
and O
largely O
attributed O
it O
to O
over O
use O
of O
my O
joints O
. O
Repetitive B-DIS
stress I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O
doctor O
, O
he O
sent O
me O
to O
an O
arthritis B-DIS
specialist O
, O
I O
had O
x O
-rays O
. O
nothing O
was O
found O
. O
I O
felt B-ADR
like I-ADR
an I-ADR
old I-ADR
( I-ADR
older I-ADR
) I-ADR
man I-ADR
during O
this O
period O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
finished O
in O
terms O
of O
my O
trade O
and O
the O
things O
I O
enjoy O
most O
, O
like O
hiking O
. O
My O
prescription O
of O
lipitor O
ran O
out O
a O
few O
months O
after O
these O
tests O
were O
done O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
bother O
refilling O
it O
right O
away O
and O
noticed O
my O
knees O
and O
elbows O
felt O
better O
. O
I O
renewed O
the O
prescription O
and O
no O
sooner O
had O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
again O
that O
I O
felt O
the O
stiff B-ADR
joints I-ADR
return O
. O
So O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
, O
the O
stiffness B-ADR
goes O
away O
, O
started O
again O
, O
stiffness B-ADR
returns O
. O
After O
telling O
my O
doctor O
this O
story O
, O
right O
away O
he O
says O
oh O
yeah O
, O
that O
's O
probably O
right O
Pardon O
! O
? O
So O
why O
did O
n't O
you O
mention O
that O
possibility O
before O
all O
the O
tests O
? O
( O
luckily O
since O
I O
live O
in O
Canada O
, O
these O
tests O
were O
all O
covered O
by O
our O
health O
care O
system O
) O
I O
did O
n't O
make O
the O
connection O
to O
lipitor O
earlier O
because O
stiff O
, O
swollen B-DIS
joints I-DIS
were O
not O
listed O
as O
one O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
Sore B-DIS
muscles I-DIS
yes O
, O
stiff B-DIS
swollen I-DIS
joints I-DIS
, O
no O
. O
I O
can O
see O

coming O
against O

This O
is O
so O
weird O
, O
I O
came O
on O
this O
site O
due O
to O
wanting O
to O
know O
why O
I O
was O
having O
the O
hip B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
feeling O
like O
. O
! O
This O
is O
the O
2nd O
time O
I O
got O
on O
Lipitor O
. O
Dummy O
me O
, O
got O
off O
cause O
I O
was O
not O
feeling O
good O
taking O
it O
and O
was O
going O
to O
have O
surgery O
so O
I O
got O
off O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
after O
taking O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
and O
did O
feel O
better O
. O
Both O
times O
I O
have O
taken O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
have O
gotten O
some O
lower B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
( O
almost O
like O
a O
disc O
out O
of O
place)impossible O
to I-ADR
move I-ADR
. O
After O
reading O
this O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
Lipitor O
is O
causing O
all O
this O
. O
I O
did O
feel O
better O
health O
and O
mood O
and O
no O
pain B-DIS
before O
I O
started O
taking O
this O
Lipitor O
both O
times O
. O
I O
am O
amazed O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
dawn O
on O
me O
. O
Have O
a O
5 O
month O
supply O
but O
getting O
off O
quick!. O

Lipitor O
did O
help O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
has O
caused O
other O
health O
problems O
not O
listed O
in O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
have O
had O
digestion B-ADR
problems I-ADR
since O
I O
have O
started O
taking O
this O
, O
my O
pancreas B-ADR
is I-ADR
very I-ADR
swollen I-ADR
. O
I O
have O
been O
through O
every O
test O
possible O
, O
and O
they O
can O
not O
find O
anything O
wrong O
with O
me O
. O
I O
have O
lost O
35 O
lbs O
, O
and O
have O
recently O
just O
heard O
that O
this O
has O
happened O
to O
other O
lipitor O
patients O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
, O
and O
feel O
better O
already!. O
Please O

This O

--insomnia O
, O
hideously B-ADR
increased I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
tension I-ADR
, O
short B-ADR
tempered I-ADR
, O

It O
really O
helped O

, O
but O
the O
agitation B-ADR
is O
unbearable O
. O
I O
got O
spasms B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
back I-ADR
from O
it O
and O
had O
to O
get O
therapy O
for O
those O
. O
I O
know O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
with O
the O
tiny O
dose O
I O
' O
m O
taking O
, O
& O
they O
say O
no O
systemic O

I O
' O

gone O
on O

off O

Had O
n't O

I O
read O
this O
but O
I O
get O
the O
hunger B-ADR
pangs I-ADR
too O
, O
I O
' O
m O
assuming O
this O
is O
the O
acids O
and O
gas O
in O
your O
stomach O
constantly O
churning O
over O
that O
make O
you O
feel O

you O

I O
' O
ve O
taken O
co O

I O
have O
very O
few O
side O
effects O
with O

I O
' O
ve O
recently O
had O
this O
severe B-DIS
hip I-DIS
pain I-DIS
on O
both O
sides O
which O
the O
co O
coamo O
was O
n't O
touching O
so O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
Dr O
He O
recommended O
this O
anti O

and O
as O
he O
said O
next O
stop O
would O
be O
cortisone O

I O
was O
willing O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O

I O
' O

tried O
it O
for O
a O
week O
but O
it O

me O
feel B-ADR
dreadful I-ADR
. O
Every O
time O
I O
stand O
up O
I O
have O
to O
hold O
onto O

for O
fear B-ADR
of I-ADR
falling I-ADR
over I-ADR
, O
I O
feel O
sick B-ADR
and O
light B-ADR

and O
I O

of O
nausea B-ADR
where O
you O
suddenly O
feel B-ADR
all I-ADR
clammy I-ADR
. O
It O
's O
very O
much O
like O
having O
a O
permanent B-ADR
hangover I-ADR
, O
even O
down O
to O
the O
hunger B-ADR
which O
until O
I O

I O
had O

I O
' O
ve O
felt O
no O
discernible O
difference O
in O
the O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
hips I-DIS
and O
the O
side O
effects O
simply O
are O

ate O
an O
excellent O

It O
did O
help O
my O
arthritis B-DIS

but O
in O
my O
opinion O
the O
possibility O
of O
side O

was O
not O
taken O
very O
seriously O
. O
It O
can O
kill O
you O
: O

of O

if O

used O
to O
make O

soon O
as O
i O
took O
lipitor O
that O

i O
' O

very O
happy O
something O

Now O
I O

trouble O
sitting O

Frequent O

up O

anxiety B-ADR
all O
day O

I O
definitely O
would O
not O
recommend O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
keep O
telling O
the O
NP O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O

says O
its O
working O
so O
I O

it O

. O
Eight O
mos O
. O
ago O
another O
doctor O
put O
me O
on O
Lipitor O
10 O
mg O
daily O
because O
my O
chol O
was O
240 O
. O
Over O
a O
period O
of O
6 O
mos O
. O
, O
it O
went O
down O
to O
159 O
, O
which O
was O
great O
, O
BUT O
I O
started O
having O
terrible O
aching B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
about O
that O
time O
which O
was O
radiating O
down O
my O
arms O
from O
my O
shoulder O
to O
my O
hands O
and O
I O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
well I-ADR
at O
all O
. O
I O
lost B-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
strength I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
and O
was O
fatigued B-ADR
all O
the O
time O
. O
I O
was O
blaming O
my O
arthritis B-DIS
for O
my O
pain B-ADR
for O
months O
and O
months O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
extra O
Relafen O
and O
Prednisone O
which O
helped O
only O
temporary O
. O
I O
could B-ADR
hardly I-ADR
lift I-ADR
a I-ADR
glass I-ADR
of O
milk O
without O
using O
both O
hands O
, O
I O
was O
so O
weak B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
and I-ADR
hands I-ADR
. O
One O
day O
it O
just O
hit O
me O
. O
Maybe O
it O
's O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
It O
was O
the O
newest O
drug O
I O
was O
taking O
. O
So O
, O
I O
just O
quit O
taking O
it O
and O
within O
3 O
days O
my O
arm O
. O
I O
suggest O
anyone O
who O
develops O
a O
bad O
sumption O
within O
a O
week O
or O
month O
of O
going O
on O
Lipitor O
, O
or O
any O
other O
statin O
drug O
, O
quit O
taking O
it O
and O
call O
your O
doctor O
. O
There O
are O
some O
important O
reasons O
why O
some O
people O
HAVE O
to O
be O
on O
a O
statin O
in O
some O
cases O
. O

Extreme B-ADR

In O
only O
one O
day O
of O
taking O

I O
nearly O
died O
. O
I O
was O
45 O
years O
old O
when O
I O
took O
lipitor O
. O
Terrible O
mistake O
. O
My O
son O
almost O
died O
after O
taking O
lipitor O
for O
two O
months O
. O
His O
liver B-ADR
was I-ADR
functioning I-ADR
at I-ADR
only I-ADR
50 I-ADR
% I-ADR
and O
he O
was O
saved O
by O
being O
admitted O
into O
the O

for O
3 O

His O

not O

be O
working O
reasonably O
well O
-- O
brought O
my O
triglycerides O
and O
LDL O
down O
to O
normal O
levels O
but O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
's O
really O
from O
the O
Lipitor O
or O
from O

In O

Lipitor O
had O
the O

At O
the O

I O

not O

any O

, O
until O
a O

I O
experienced O

, O
sometimes O
I O
could O
not O
even O

told O
me O
to O
stop O

went O
away O

that O
sometimes O
I O
could O

even O
turn O
my O
head O
when O
I O
was O
driving O

I O
went O
to O
my O

thought O
it O
was O
stress B-DIS

I O
took O
off O

during O
this O
time O
I O
tried O
to O

the O

not O

I O
feel O

I O
do O
not O

I O

looking O
for O
another O
drug O
to O
replace O
this O
one O
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
OB O
GYN O
thinking O
there O
was O
something B-DIS
wrong I-DIS
with I-DIS
my I-DIS
uterus I-DIS
but O
I O
am O
completely O
ok O
. O
I O
am O
not O
taking O
it O
again O
. O

After O
taking O
it O
for O
3 O
-4 O
months O
I O
had O
terrible B-ADR
pains I-ADR
in I-ADR
knee I-ADR
, I-ADR
ankle I-ADR
, I-ADR
big I-ADR
toe I-ADR
. O
Could O
n't O
walk O
or O
even O
sleep O

comfortably O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
gout O
, O
which O
runs O
in O
my O
family O
. O
HMO O
doctors O
said O
not O
gout O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
. O
I O
finally O
stumbled O
on O
this O
web O
site O
, O
and O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
and O
immediately O
got O
some O
relief O
. O
That O
was O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
ago O
. O
Still O
have O
some O
pain O
and O
other O
weird I-ADR

, I-ADR
big I-ADR
toe I-ADR
joints O
, O
but O
it O
is O
gradually O
getting O
less O
. O
This O
drug O
is O
too O
dangerous O
to O
use O
. O
We O
need O
something O
with O
the O
same O
good O
effects O
, O
but O
not O
the O
danger O
. O

muscle B-ADR

. O
When O
I O
notified O
the O
prescribing O
doctor O
ther O
was O
a O
problem O
, O
he O
eventually O
said O
that O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
medication O
and O
the O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
legs I-ADR
should O
subside O
in O
eight O
or O
nine O
weeks O
. O
It O
finlay O
took O
fifteen O
weeks O
and O
left O
me O
with O
two O
failed B-ADR
knee I-ADR
joints I-ADR
that O
were O
perfect O
before O
taking O
the O
medication O
. O
The O
product O
should O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
market O
for O
further O
evaluation O
. O

Side O
effects O
were O
minimal O
, O
affected O
areas O
dryad O
up O
and O
fell O
off O
. O

The O
lipitor O
works O
for O
lowering O
cholesterol O
levels O
. O
However O
, O
I O
wonder O
if O
there O
is O
a O
coronation O
between O
lipitor O
( O
statins O
) O
and O
restless B-DIS
legs I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
( I-DIS
rls I-DIS
) I-DIS
. O
I O
' O
ve O
talked O
with O
a O
couple O
others O
that O
have O
rls B-DIS
and O
they O
are O
on O
lipitor O
too O
. O
Does O
anyone O
taking O
lipitor O
experience O
rls O
? O
I O
'll O
check O
back O
here O
for O
the O
results O
. O

no O
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
after O
taking O
lipitor O
my O
ankles B-ADR
and I-ADR
the I-ADR
soles I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
feet I-ADR
feels I-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
walking I-ADR
on I-ADR
hot I-ADR
coals I-ADR
I O
blamed O
my O
new O
shoes O
i O
bought O
. O
So O
I O
bought O
a O
new O
pair O
from O
the O
chemist O
they O
did O
n't O
stop O
the O
pain B-ADR
either O
. O
I O
was O
at O
a O
local O
club O
about O
2 O
months O
later O
walked O
into O
the O
toilet O
I O
'd O
been O
in O
there O
many O
times O
before O
but O
this O
I O
could O
n't O
work O
out O
witch O
door O
to O
walk O
out(I O
think O
it O
also O
has O
an O
effect B-ADR
on I-ADR
your I-ADR
memory I-ADR
) O
. O
Also O
I O
suffer O
badly O
from O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
from O
my O
neck O
& O
shoulders O
to O
my O
lower O
back O
. O
My O
wife O
also O
took O
lipitor O
but O
has O
since O
stopped O
but O
it O
effected O
her O
a O
lot O
worse O
than O
me O
. O
She O
has O
since O
stopped O
taking O
any O
medication O
it O
's O
been O
6 O
months O
and O
still O
recovering O
from O
the O
effects O
. O
I O
am O
now O
taking O
Emetrol O
a O
lot O
better O
. O
I O
still O
get O
pains B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
back I-ADR
but O
not O
as O
bad O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
the O
doctors O
would O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
side O
affects O
to O
expect O
. O

My O
elder O
brother O

was O
put O
on O
the O
same O
medicine O
for O
blood O
pressure O
in O
the O
age O
of O
45 O
years O
which O
definitely O
resulted O
into O
causing O
him O
ALS B-ADR
in O
the O
last O
three O
years O
before O
his O
tragic O
death O
without O
any O
cure O
. O
He O
developed O
the O
symptoms O
like O

in O
the O
last O

less I-ADR

leading O
to O
his O
painful O
death O
in O
the O
last O
time O
. O
I O
strongly O
feel O
the O
lipitor O
had O
the O
crucial O
side O
effect O
upon O
my O
brother O
causing O
him O
to O
suffer O
with O
ALS B-ADR
for O
which O
there O
is O
reportedly O
no O
cure O
in O
Allopathy O
, O
while O
therefore O
i O
put O
my O
brother O
on O
Homeopathic O
treatment O
which O
at O
least O
avoided O
the O
bad O
effect O
. O
Please O
avoid O
the O
allopathic O
treatment O
and O
follow O
the O
Yoga O
-system O
or O
regular O
physical O
exercise O
to O
prevent O
the O

I O
was O
on O

3 O

Then O
I O
sated O
having O
hip B-ADR

It O
finally O
go O

that O
I O
could O

Also O
, O
bouts O

I O
went O
off O
the O

and O
within O
3 O
days O
the O
pains B-ADR
were O
going O
away O
, O
10 O
days O
and O
all O
was O
well O
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
med O
as O
long O
as O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
My O
MD O
says O
that O
it O
is O
soluble O
in O
fat O
and O
builds O
up O
in O
the O
muscle O
. O
He O
switched O
me O
to O
Crestor O
, O
similar O
med O
, O
but O
water O
soluble O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
build O
up O
in O
your O
body O
as O
much O
. O
So O

so O
good O

with O

then O
getting O
up O

my B-ADR

someone I-ADR
who I-ADR
could I-ADR

Have O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
and O
symptoms O
seem O
to O
be O
subsiding O

Lipitor O
worked O
great O

but O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
not O
worth O
the O
benefit O
. O

Some O
stomach B-ADR

, O
feels O
a O
bit O
like O
my O
pressure B-ADR
is I-ADR
up I-ADR
( O
in O
my O
head O
mostly O
) O
. O
I O
pulled B-DIS
my I-DIS
lower I-DIS
back I-DIS
at O
the O
gym O
2 O
times O
. O
last O
time O
was O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
was O
pretty O
bad O
. O
Since O
then O
my O
back O
has O
really O
gotten O
worse O
. O
I O
still O
exercise O
everyday O
and O
stretch O
, O
but O
it O
really O
is O
not O
helping O
. O
I O
final O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O
and O
i O
am O
getting O
x O

on O
my O

tomorrow O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
about O
25 O

. O
3 O
days O
later O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
how O
good O
my O
back O
feels O
. O
It O
has O
to O
be O
this O
drub O
, O
because O
this O
is O
the O
first O
day O
i O
can O
comfortably O
bend O
down O
with O
no O
pain B-DIS
and O
even O
touch O
my O
toes O
without O
bending O
my O
knees O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
this O
drug O
, O
like O
many O
drugs O
, O
works O
for O
some O
and O
not O
for O
all O
. O
as O
for O

seems O
to O
be O
really O
good O

12 O
days O
: O
On O
day O
3 O
, O
I O
felt O

above I-ADR
a I-ADR

Thought O
I O
had O
somehow O
injured O
it O
- O
but O
the O
pain B-ADR
vanished O
in O
a O
day O
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
I O
felt O
stabbing B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
spine I-ADR
and O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
thrown O
my O
back O
out O
. O
I O
was O
hunched O
over O
to O
the O
left O
and O
figured O
it O
would O
take O
a O
week O
to O
get O
better O
, O
but O
the O
pain B-ADR
vanished O
after O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
day O
. O
I O
started O
feeling O
an O
odd B-ADR
sensation I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
center I-ADR
back I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
calves I-ADR
. O
I O
put B-ADR

on I-ADR
suddenly I-ADR
for I-ADR
no I-ADR
reason I-ADR
and O
ringing B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR

increased I-ADR
. O
Next O
the O
calf B-ADR
sensation I-ADR
turned I-ADR
painful I-ADR
at O
night O
and O
started O
increasing O
. O
I O
figured O
out O
these O
issues O
all O
might O
be O
caused O
by O
Lipitor O
and O
stopped O
taking O
it O
immediately O
. O
But O
the O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR

continued O
to O
get O
worse O
for O
several O
days O
! O
My O
legs O
were O
waking O
me O
up O
at O
night O
and O
were O
all O
contorted O

I O
' O

never O

Because O

If O

a O
trigger O
for O
your O

, O
do O
NOT O
take O
this O

Most O

I O
would O
rather O
just O

Upon O

it O

Over O
the O

many O
ways O
that O
I O
noticed O
some O
of O
you O

Is O
it O
because O
we O
are O

you O

I O
am O
43 O
years O
old O
and O
have O
been O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
. O
I O
am O
having O
horrible O
aching B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
fingers I-ADR
, I-ADR
knees I-ADR
, I-ADR
hips I-ADR

toes I-ADR
. O
Went O
to O
my O
yearly O
exam O
this O
week O
and O
blood O
test O
reveals O
arthritis B-DIS
. O
No O
family O
history O
of O
arthritis B-DIS
, O
has O
to O
be O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
The O
drug O
did O
bring O
my O
cholesterol O
down O
over O
100 O
points O
- O
but O
is O
it O
worth O
having O
arthritis B-DIS
to O
achieve O
that O
? O
. O

The O
very O
first O
day O
I O
took O
20 O
mg O
of O
lipitor O
I O
experienced O
a O
severe B-ADR
headache I-ADR
and O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
I O
felt O
light B-ADR
headed I-ADR
and O
shaky B-ADR
. O
By O
the O
fifth O
day O
I O
felt B-ADR
flu I-ADR
-like I-ADR
and O
very O
sick O
. O
The O
headache B-ADR
was O
constant O
and O
only O
Aleve O
slightly O
helped O
it O
. O
I O
would O
sit O
with O
a O
heating O
pad O
for O
hours O
on O
my O
neck O
. O
On O
day O
6 O
I O
called O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
told O
me O
to O
stop O
taking O
lipitor O
. O
This O
is O
my O
3rd O
day O
off O
the O
drug O
and O
I O
feel O
90 O
% O
better O
. O
I O
only O
had O
a O
slight O
headache B-ADR
and O
shoulder B-ADR
ache I-ADR
today O
. O
There O
are O
solo O
many O
people O
that O
take O
lipitor O
and O
never O
have O
a O
side O
effect O
and O
they O
achieve O
wonderful O
results O
. O
I O
will O
never O
take O
it O
again O
. O
Now O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
about O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
really O
do O
not O
want O
to O
take O
another O
drug O
. O
I O
know O
my O
doctor O
will O
laugh O
at O
natural O
remedies O
and O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
do O
it O
, O
but O
I O
will O
try O

unexplained B-ADR
cough I-ADR
. O
Doctors O
was O
unaware O
of O
this O
being O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
stopped O
using O
it O
3 O
days O
ago O
and O
the O
cough B-ADR
is O
gone O
. O
Last O
week O
, O
also O
stopped O
for O
two O
days O
and O
the O
cough B-ADR
stopped O
. O
Each O
time O
I O
go O
back O
to O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
begin O
to O
cough B-ADR
heavily I-ADR
. O

It O
seems O
as O
if O
bleeding B-ADR
forever O
is O
a O
side O
effect O
but O
doctors O
tell O
you O
that O
its O
not O
the O
drug O
I O
have O
been O
on O
Orthotic O
for O
Three O
months O
I O
still O
have O
pain B-DIS
and I-DIS
stiffness I-DIS
at O
first O
week O
into O
this O
drug O
I O
was O
in O
so B-ADR
much I-ADR
pain I-ADR
I O
sat O
on O
the O
floor O
at O
work O
and O
thought O
I O
was O
having O
a O
baby O
. O
I O
always O
feel B-ADR
weak I-ADR
and I-ADR
almost I-ADR
fainted I-ADR
a O
bunch O
of O
times O
. O
Consider O
something O
that O
works O
I O
am O
switching O
today O
as O
this O
is O
nt O
in O
my O
head O
. O

Soon O
after O
starting O
Lipitor O
I O
developed O
extreme O
pain B-ADR
in O
both O
inner O
arms O
at O
the O
elbows O
, O
over O
the O
next O
years O
I O
developed O
inflammed B-ADR
ligaments I-ADR
and I-ADR
bursae I-ADR
in O
my O
shoulders O
and O
ankles O
. O
Also O
Nerve B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
shoulders O
, O
ankles O
and O
feet O
. O
Finally O
extreme O
burning B-ADR
of I-ADR
shoulders I-ADR
and I-ADR
ankles I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
started O
on O
Lipitor O
20 O
mg O
7 O
years O
ago O
. O
It O
was O
increased O
to O
40 O
mg O
. O
3 O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
increased O
proportionately O
to O
the O
time O
I O
was O
on O
the O
drug O
and O
the O
dose O
increase O
. O
Neither O
my O
doctors O
nor O
I O
ever O
related O
these O
pains O
to O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
stopped O
Lipitor O
six O
months O
ago O
as O
an O
experiment O
. O
Within O
3 O
weeks O
I O
had O
recovered O
about O
50 O
% O
. O
I O
ve O
not O
recovered O
past O
this O
point O
. O
I O
still O
ca O
n't O
walk O
without O
extreme B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
I O
have O
to O
wear O
ankle O
supports O
, O
night O
splints O
, O
ice O
compresses O
frequently O
, O
gel O
pads O
, O
elevated O
heels O
. O
My O
shoulders B-DIS
are I-DIS
doing I-DIS
better I-DIS
than I-DIS
my I-DIS
ankles I-DIS
and I-DIS
feet I-DIS
, I-DIS
but I-DIS
they I-DIS
still I-DIS
hurt I-DIS
. O
My O
GP O
and O
the O
surgeon O
who O
says O
I O
now O
need O
surgery O
on O
both O
ankles O
for O
the O
inflammed B-DIS
bursae I-DIS
are O
reluctant O
to O
connect O
my O
pain B-DIS
and O
disability B-DIS
. O
My O
GP O
still O
wants O
me O
on O
statins O
. O
She O
is O
annoyed O
that O
I O
will O
not O
take O
any O
. O
I O
am O
taking O
Red O
Yeast O
Rice O
with O
COQ10 O
now O
instead O
of O
a O
statin O
along O
with O
2000 O
mg O
of O
Vitamin O
C O
daily O
. O
Basically O
Lipitor O
has O
ruined O
my O
formerly O
active O
life O
. O
No O
more O
dancing O
, O
golf O
, O
hiking O
, O
even O
standing O
too O

I O
will O
have O
my O
cholesterol O
rechecked O
in O
September O
to O
see O
if O
the O
Red O
Yeast O
Rice O
helps O
my O
elevated B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
never O
warned O
that O
any O
of O
the O
symptoms O
I O
have O
experienced O
were O
in O
any O
way O
related O
to O
Lipitor O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
about O
a O

no O
major O

but O
recently O
I O
have O

Doctor O
told O
me O
to O
discontinue O
Lipitor O
which O
I O
just O
did O
a O
couple O
days O
ago O
and O
I O
should O
know O
in O
a O
month O
or O
so O
if O
this O
is O
the O
cause O
( O
glossitis B-ADR
and O
other O
symptoms O
are O
listed O
as O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
although O
in O
my O
case O
it O
's O
been O
a O
delayed O
reaction O
) O
Lipitor O
did O
bring O
my O
cholesterol O
down O
from O
268 O
to O
153 O
but O
I O
want O
the O
glossitis B-ADR
, O
headaches B-ADR
and O
dizziness B-ADR
to O
go O
away O
. O
I O
hate O
feeling O
this O
way O
. O
I O
will O
find O
another O
way O
to O
control O
my O
cholesterol O
if O
Lipitor O
proves O
to O
be O
the O
culprit O

out O

Many O
are O
sharing O
the O

effects O
and O
I O
know O
now O
that O
I O
am O
not O
imagining O
them O
. O
I O
have O
been O
on O
Lipitor O
40 O
mg O
. O
for O
some O
years O
now O
. O
It O
did O
help O
my O
reduction O
of O
high O
cholesterol O
. O
It O
was O
also O
a O
gradual O
onset O
of O
all O
the O
above O
mentioned O
; O
This O
is O
. O

After O
four O
months O
on O
20 O
mg O
suffered O
calf B-ADR
pains I-ADR
in O
middle O
of O
night O
. O
After O
6 O
months O
cut O
dose O
in O
half O
, O
still O
calf B-ADR
pains I-ADR
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O
Now O
after O
2 O
+ O
years O
noticed O
my O
left O
hip B-ADR
was I-ADR
bothering I-ADR
me O
so O
that O
sometimes O
I O
had O
to O
walk B-ADR
a I-ADR
little I-ADR
funny I-ADR
. O
Thought O
I O
might O
need O
hip O
replacement O
( O
age O
71 O
) O
, O
but O
it O
dawned O
on O
me O
that O
maybe O
the O
Lipitor O
might O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
that O
too O
. O
I O
cut O
dose O
again O
in O
half O
and O
am O
taking O
only O
5 O
mg O
. O
Now O
after O
one O
week O
I O
notice O
that O
hip B-ADR
does I-ADR
not I-ADR
hurt I-ADR
any O
more O
. O

Severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
both I-ADR
calfs I-ADR
and I-ADR
thighs I-ADR
. O
I O
became O
unable B-ADR
to I-ADR
lift I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
to I-ADR
put I-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
pants I-ADR
or I-ADR
even I-ADR
get I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
car I-ADR
. O
This O
developed O
after O
being O
on O
the O
Lipitor O
for O
about O
5 O
years O
. O
I O
was O
on O
10 O
mg O
and O
complained O
about O
discomfort B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
but O
my O
cardiologist O
just O
said O
it O
was O
old O
age O
and O
even O
upped O
my O
dose O
to O
20 O
mg O
. O
That O
really O
made O
things O
a O
lot O
worst O
and O
now O
I O
just O
stopped O
it O
and O
within O
24 O
hours O
could O
see O
an O
improvement O
. O
Incidently O
I O
am O
a O
physician O
and O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
myalgia B-ADR
with O
Lipitor O
but O
I O
suspect O
it O
is O
much O
worst O
than O
the O
drug O
company O
would O
have O
you O
believe O
. O
This O
is O
really O
a O
very O
toxic O
drug O
and O
should O
be O
used O
with O
caution O
. O
This O
is O
a O
drug O
which O
is O
very O
effective O
in O
lowering O
cholesterol O
but O
also O
affects O
many O
metabolic O
pathways O
in O
the O
body O
and O
is O
potentially O
dangerous O

It O
worked O
quite O
well O
. O
I O
was O
really O
impressed O
. O
However O
, O
after O
21/2 O
months O
, O
the O
side O
effects O
started O
. O
When O
I O
got O
the O
vertigo B-ADR
, O
I O
had O
to O
discontinue O

Did O

and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
of O

I O
began O

heavy B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR

. O
My O
period B-ADR
ended I-ADR
last I-ADR

this I-ADR

presently O
on O
crestor O
one O
time O
per O
week O
with O
occasional O
side O
effect O
of O
mild B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
MD O
said O
one O
time O
a O
week O
can O
be O
very O
effective O
for O
patients O
that O
have O
reaction O
to O
statins O
. O
Have O
not O
had O
bloodworm O
as O
yet O
to O
see O
if O
helped O
. O

Lower O
dose O
for O
first O
month O
produced O
sporadic O
intense O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
nausea B-ADR
. O
Always O
prided O
myself O
on O
having O
a O
cast O
iron O
stomach O
until O
this O
script O
came O
along O
. O
I O
have O
to O
rate O
it O
a O
5 O
for O
knee B-DIS
pain I-DIS
so O
I O
lived O
with O
it O
. O
Then O
my O
doctor O
increased O
the O
dose O
after O
one O
month O
and O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
work O
so O
well O
on O
reducing O
osteoarthritis B-DIS
pain B-DIS
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
I O
have O
also O
never O
been O
so O
sick B-ADR
from O
a O
prescription O
. O
Increased O
dosage O
produced O
constant O
, O
unyielding O
stomach B-ADR
gas I-ADR
and I-ADR
intense I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
gastrointestinal B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
pain I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
If O
your O
gastrointestinal O
system O
can O
handle O
it O
, O
its O
an O
amazingly O
effective O
arthritis B-DIS
drug O
. O
however O
I O
welcomed O
the O
knee B-DIS
pain I-DIS
back O
after O
suffering O
the O
side O
effects O
and O
booked O
an O
appointment O
with O
a O
knee O
surgeon!. O
Was O
so O
sick B-ADR
after O
2 O
days O
at O
the O
increased O
dose O
, O
I O
decided O
it O
just O
was O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

Severe B-ADR

Dr O

I O
said O
no O

I O

try O

I O

I O
do O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
the O
immediate O
difference O
this O
medication O
had O
made O
in O

I O
could O
not O

without O
holding O
onto O

walking B-DIS
up I-DIS
the I-DIS

intolerable I-DIS
. O
Within O
one O

I O

I O
am O
now O
walking O
up O

Shortly O

! O
! O
Take O
everything O
with O
a O
pinch O
of O
salt O
; O
be O
healthily O
sceptical O
; O
go O
slowly O
and O
be O
wary O
, O
but O
do O
n't O
cut O
your O
life O
short O
by O

against O

My O
doctor O
switched O
me O
from O
Pravachol O
to O
Lipitor O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
because O
of O
a O
study O
that O
was O
done O
in O
CHF O
patients O
and O
when O
Lipitor O
was O
used O
, O
hospitalizations O
were O
cut O
almost O
in O
half O
. O
Normally O
I O
have O
to O
go O
into O
the O
hospital O
a O
minimum O
of O
2 O
times O
a O
year O
. O
Since O
I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
the O
hospital O
even O
once O
! O
Also O
, O
he O
also O
told O
me O
that O
Lipitor O
was O
better O
for O
my O
kidneys O
than O
the O
statins O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Arthritic O
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
that O
it O
does O
help O
deal O
with O
my O
back B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
However O
. O
over O
the O
last O
six O
months O
, O
I O
have O
started O
having O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
almost O
every O
day O
of O
the O
month O
. O
Lots O
of O
clotting B-ADR
, I-ADR
and I-ADR
horrible I-ADR
periods I-ADR
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
organ O
and O
everything O
came O
out O
normal O
. O
The O
doc O
put O
me O
on O
birth O
control O
. O
But O
, O
the O
bleeding B-ADR
has I-ADR
not I-ADR
subsided I-ADR
. O
So O
now O
I O
am O
scheduled O
to O
have O
an O
endometrial O
biopsy O
on O
We O
d. O
I O
had O
an O
epiphany O
last O
night O
about O
Arthritic O
and O
began O
researching O
the O
side O
effect O
. O
When O
I O
came O
across O
this O
website O
, O
I O
was O
appalled O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
females O
mention O
heavy B-ADR
/extra I-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
. O
I O
firmly O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
answer O
to O
my O
bleeding B-ADR
problem I-ADR
and O
will O
be O
telling O
the O
doctor O
on O
Monday O
, O
. O
Although O
this O
drug O
has O
helped O
with O
the O
pain B-DIS
, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
cost O
and O
hassle O
of O
bleeding B-ADR
constantly I-ADR
. O
, O
On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
I O
am O
now O
having O
to O
have O
a O
procedure O
that O
a O
31 O
year O
old O
should O
not O
have O
to O
endure O
. O
I O
truly O
hope O
that O
there O
are O
no O
long O
term O
effects O
from O
this O
. O
I O
have O
not O
taken O
Arthritic O
in O
almost O
a O
week O
, O
yet O
I O
am O
still O
bleeding B-ADR
. O
I O
do O
not O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
extra B-DIS
pains I-DIS
I O
will O
likely O
experience O
in O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
can O
find O
something O
else O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
. O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
have O
become O
dependent O
on O
this O
medicine O
to O
function O
. O

NSAID O
gastritis B-ADR
, O
severe B-ADR

, O
menstrual B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
present I-ADR
with I-ADR
or I-ADR
without I-ADR
vaginal I-ADR

. O
i O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
medication O
for O
any O
female O
who O
has O
not O
already O
completed O
their O
menopausal B-DIS
phase I-DIS
. O

Severe B-ADR
elbow I-ADR
, I-ADR
arm I-ADR
and I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
It O
's O
just O
a O
little O
white O
pill O
, O
this O
ca O
n't O
be O
causing O
all O
of O
my O
pain O
. O
Boy O
was O
I O
wrong O
, O
this O
pill O
has O
caused O
me O
so O
much O
grief O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
even O
watch O
TV O
with O
my O
family O
as O
the O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
and I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
drove O
me O
to O
my O
bed O
. O
I O
felt O
so O
old O
and O
scared O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
would O
be O
pain B-ADR
filled O
. O
One O
week O
ago O
I O
ran O
out O
of O
lipitor O
and O
after O
a O
few O
days O
found O
that O
my O
arm B-ADR
& I-ADR
elbow I-ADR
pain I-ADR
subsided O
. O
Why O
is O
n't O
this O
widely O
known O
? O
I O
' O
m O
angry O
and O
also O
sad O
, O
sad O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
wasted O
all O
this O
time O
and O
angry O
that O
the O
drug O
companies O
are O
getting O
richer O
by O
the O
second O
. O

After O
taking O
Crestor O
and O
having O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
lack B-ADR
of I-ADR
control I-ADR
when O
standing O
in O
the O
mornings O
, O
my O
Dr O
prescribed O
Lipitor O

I O
have O
had O
increasing O

tingling I-ADR

with O

crawly I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
all O
over O

My O
bad O
levels O
have O
decreased O
but O
now O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
may O
have O
nerve B-DIS
damage I-DIS
or O
liver B-DIS
problems I-DIS
and O
after O
reading O
this O

will O
stop O
taking O

lasted O
about O
2 O
weeks O
. O
The O
pain O
was O
worse O
. O
Then O
I O
decided O
to O
look O
on O
the O
internet O
to O
find O
out O
what O
was O
causing O
the O
pain O
. O
It O
was O
Statin O
. O
I O
looked O
that O
up O
and O
found O
what O
it O
does O
to O
the O
body O
. O
So O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
stop O
taking O
any O
drug O
and O
take O
some O
Q10 O
to O
build O
my O
body O
back O
up O
. O
Two O
months O
later O
went O
back O
on O
Lipitor O
with O
the O
Q10 O
. O
2 O
months O
later O
, O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
back O
. O
Twice O
as O
bad O
as O
before O
, O
plus O
a O
whole O
bunch O
of O
other O
side O
effects O
, O
you O
see O
I O
' O
m O
seriously O
allergic O
to O
the O
Statin O
. O
And O
I O
know O
now O
, O
why O
I O
should O
have O
known O
this O
, O
but O
no O
one O
told O
me O
about O
it O
. O
When O
you O
are O
taking O
Statin O
and O
drink O
alcohol O
the O
side O
effects O
increase O
dramatically O
. O
When O
ever O
I O
drank O
, O
sipped O
a O
little O
wine O
, O
by O
body O
hurt O
so O
bad O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
the O
flu O
. O
And O
no O
Aleve O
, O
or O
pain O
killer O
would O
help O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
allergic O
to O
the O
alcohol O
. O
But O
now O
I O
know O
it O
was O
the O
Statin O
. O
Here O
are O
a O
list O
of O
the O
side O
-effects O
I O
had O
, O
that O
started O
slowly O
and O
in O

During O
the O
two O
years O
, O
I O
was O
on O
the O
Lipitor O
, O
all O
these O
symptoms O
started O
out O
slowly O
. O
First O
came O
the O
tinnitus B-ADR
. O
My O
Dr O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
ear O
Dr. O
Found O
no O
problem O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
live O
with O
it O
. O
Second O

, O
Dr O

. O
Then O
came O

, O
Dr O
put O
me O
on O
Rhinoceri O
. O
During O
all O
this O
I O
felt O

I O
was O
80 O
years O
old O
. O
My O
neck B-ADR
hurt I-ADR
, O
my O
hips B-ADR
hurt I-ADR
. O
We O
got O
a O
$ O
3,000.00 O
sleep O
by O
number O
bed O
to O
relieve O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O
Did O
n't O
really O
help O
. O
Insomnia B-ADR
was O
constant O
. O
I O
got O
hooked O
on O
Tylenol O
PM O
. O
I O
gained B-ADR
a I-ADR
lot I-ADR
of I-ADR
weight I-ADR
. O
Went O
to O
Lindera O
to O
loss O
weight O
, O
so O
I O
could O
get O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
Lost O
40 O
lbs O
. O
Dr O
said O
to O
stay O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
prevention O
. O
This O
is O
when O
I O
decided O
to O
check O
it O
out O
on O
the O
internet O
. O
When O
I O
went O
back O
on O
the O
Lipitor O
, O
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
, O
I O
had O
a O
small O
drink O
of O
wine O
at O
a O
wedding O
. O
That O
night O
my O
body O
aches O
were O
so O
bad O
, O
I O
could O
hardly O
stand O
it O
. O
Then O
two O
days O
later O
I O
came O
down O
with O
bronchitis B-DIS
, O
and O
asthma B-DIS
. O
I O
have O
asthma B-DIS
anyway O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
worse O
case O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
in O
13 O
years O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
sinus B-ADR
problems I-ADR
again O
. O
My O
Dr O
took O
x O
-rays O
for O
pneumonia B-DIS
and O
sinus B-DIS
infection I-DIS
, O
Came O
back O
clear O
. O
My O
Dr O
wanted O
me O
to O
see O
an O
ear O
nose O
and O
throat O
Dr O
Then O
my O
blood O
pressure O
went O
up O
to O
198/90 O
. O
I O
have O
never O
in O
my O
life O
had O
high B-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
. O
Dr O
put O
me O
on O
Neovasc O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
two O
horrible O
nightmares B-ADR
. O
I O
finally O
, O
went O
on O
the O
internet O
and O
looked O
at O
side O
effects O
for O
Lipitor O
. O
When O
I O
saw O
all O
the O
side O
-effects O
, O
I O
nearly O
died O
. O
I O
have O
all O
the O
symptoms O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
that O
instant O
. O
That O
was O
one O
week O
ago O
. O
I O
' O
m O
starting O
feel O
a O
little O
better O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
gone O
to O
my O
Dr O
and O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
new O
about O
the O
alcohol O
related O
problem O
. O
He O
said O
, O
no O
. O
There O
is O
no O
warning O
on O
the O
prescription O
bottle O
, O
to O
tell O
you O
to O
watch O
out O
for O
a O
reaction O
with O
alcohol O
. O
The O
Dr O
is O
now O
doing O
tests O
, O
to O
see O
if O
there O
has O
been O
any O
damage O
to O
my O
heart O
and O
muscles O
. O
I O
also O
, O
asked O
for O
physical O
therapy O
for O
my O
left O
shoulder O
and O
neck O
. O
My O
left B-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
is I-ADR
almost I-ADR
immobile I-ADR
. O
I O
think O
the O
tinnitus B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
ear I-ADR
has O
been O
caused O
by O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
goes O
away O
soon O
. O
I O
also O
, O
lost B-ADR
my I-ADR
sense I-ADR
of I-ADR
taste I-ADR
during O
this O
whole O
thing O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
who O
has O
experienced O
any O
side O
effects O
increased O
by O
alcohol O
, O
to O
consider O
an O
allergic O
reaction O
to O
the O
drug O
. O
Dr O
was O
thinking O
about O
putting O
on O
another O
Statin O
drug O
. O
I O
said O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
get O
it O
, O
I O
' O
m O
allergic O
to O
it O
. O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
not O
started O
the O
drug O
, O
but O
it O
was O
prescribed O
to O
me O
by O
my O
Dr O
for O
having O
low O
HDL O
( O
good O
) O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
talked O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
and O
researched O
this O
drug O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
found O
nothing O
GOOD O
about O
it O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
alternative O
( O
herbal O
) O
medications O
to O
rise O
my O
good O
HDL O
levels O
. O
Afraid O
of O
side O
effects O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
jeapordize O
my O
health O
by O
adding O
a O
drug O
to O
my O
system O
that O
can O
harm O
me!. O

SEVERE B-ADR
FATIGUE I-ADR
IN I-ADR
MY I-ADR
BODY I-ADR
AND O
TIREDNESS B-ADR
AND O
MUSCLE B-ADR
PAINS I-ADR
IN I-ADR
MY I-ADR
HIPS I-ADR
THAT O
CONTINUE O
TO O
THIS O
DAY O
AFTER O
BEING O
OFF O
THE O
DRUG O
FOR O
ALMOST O
A O
YEAR O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG!!!!!!!. O
I O
was O
put O
on O
this O
drug O
by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
felt B-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
had I-ADR
aged I-ADR
to I-ADR
eighty I-ADR
years I-ADR
old I-ADR
overnight I-ADR
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
Lipitor O
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
feeling B-ADR
all I-ADR
that I-ADR
age I-ADR
caught I-ADR
up I-ADR
with I-ADR
you I-ADR
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
Lipitor O
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
Lipitor O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
I B-ADR
was I-ADR
eighty I-ADR
years I-ADR
old I-ADR
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
Lipitor O
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
hypochondriac B-DIS
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
eighty B-ADR
years I-ADR
old I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
Lipitor O
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O
statins O
because O
he O
was O
still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
Zeta O
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O
affects O
of O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
Lipitor O
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O
did O
have O
neck B-DIS
pains I-DIS
that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
side O
affect O
, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O
drug O
two O
years O
before O
this O
developed O
. O
I O
told O
him O
of O
the O
information O
on O
this O
site O
that O
describes O
some O
people O
having O
that O
delayed O
reaction O
and O
I O
advised O
him O
to O
take O
himself O
off O
of O
this O
drug O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
the O
neck O
pains O
cleared O
up O
! O
I O

, O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG!!!!!. O

! O
My O
doctor O
wanted O
me O
to O
switch O
from O
Lipitor O
to O
Lipidic O
Micro O
as O
I O
was O
so O
upset O
by O
the O
hair O

and O
muscle O
pain O
but O
I O
have O
stopped O
having O
muscle O
pain O
by O
taking O

and O
before O
I O
switch O
to O
another O
drug O
that O
may O
have O
other O

, O
I O
want O
to O
research O

) O
further O
. O
If O
anyone O
has O
experienced O
hair O
loss O
on O
Lipidic O
please O
let O
me O
know O

First O
the O
doc O
thought O
I O
had O
gastritis B-DIS
from O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
abdomen I-ADR
, O
headaches B-ADR
, O
flushing B-ADR
- O
I O
had O
an O
abdominal O
ultrasound O
, O
endoscopy O
, O
then O
CT O
scans O
( O
2 O
) O
and O
then O
yesterday O
an O
MRI O
- O
all O
were O
normal O
. O
The O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
headaches B-ADR
, O
and O
general B-ADR
malaise I-ADR
continue O
. O
I O
am O
taking O
myself O
off O
this O
drug O
and O
hope O
that O
my O
apparently O
healthy O
body O
recovers O
. O
Why O
is O
my O
doctor O
unaware O
of O
the O
Lipitor O
side O
effects O
? O
Why O
did O
I O
spend O
almost O
$ O
1,000 O
of O
my O
own O
money O
AFTER O
insurance O
on O
all O
these O
tests O
without O
considering O
that O
my O
symptoms O
match O
those O
for O
Lipitor O
? O
So O
frustrating O
! O
I O
will O
check O
back O
in O
and O
document O
how O
I O
feel O
in O
a O
month O
. O

ione O
of O
the O
reasons O
I O
left O
my O
job O

because O
I O
was O
so O
weak B-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR
and O
had O
difficulty B-ADR
walking I-ADR
and O
driving O
. O
I O
was O
a O
Sales O
rep O
for O
a O
drug O
company O
and O
many O
years O
ago O
I O
promoted O
Zocor O
. O
How O
IRONIC O
that O
I O
should O
suffer O
from O
statins O
my O
self O
. O
My O
life O
is O
miserable O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
dying O
. O
I O
am O
sorry O
I O
did O
not O
keep O
my O
weight O
low O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
my O
lipids O
to O
go O
so O
high O
. O
That O
way O
I O
would O
have O
never O
had O
to O
suffer O
like O
I O
am O
now O
. O
The O
doctors O
just O
say O
and O
my O
husband O
OH O
your O
in O
pain B-ADR
because O
you O
are O
over B-DIS
weight I-DIS
. O
The O
doctors O
also O
did O
not O
even O
follow O
me O
up O
properly O
. O
who O
can O
I O
sue O
? O
? O

it O
looks O

my O

the O
Lipitor O

Doctor O
referring O
me O
to O
a O

for O

ask O
about O

Lowered O
my O

9/20/05 O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
taking O
cholesterol O
lowering O
meds O
for O
at O
least O
10 O
years O
including O
Mevacor O
, O
Zocor O
, O
Lipitor O
and O
Zeta O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
went O
from O
398 O
to O
260 O
on O
40 O
Lipitor O
. O
This O
year O
I O
was O
given O
80 O
mps O
of O
Lipitor O
and O
Zeta O
was O
added O
as O
well O
. O
Along O
with O
the O
increased O
dosage O
, O
came O
crippling O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
back I-ADR
, I-ADR
neck I-ADR
and O
then O
just O
my O
left O
foot O
, O
severe O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
neck I-ADR
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
could O
n't O
hold O
it O
up O
without O
an O
effort O
, O
increased O
sinus B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
high B-ADR
blood I-ADR

, O
insomnia B-ADR
, O
blurred B-ADR
thinking I-ADR
. O
So O
to O
fix O
all O
these O
problems O
, O
I O
was O
given O
lots O
of O
other O
meds O
and O
tons O
of O
physical O
therapy O
and O
exercise O
each O
day O
. O
All O
so O
I O
could O
have O
great O
numbers O
. O
Finally O
, O
I O
realized O
enough O
was O
enough O
, O
I O
called O
the O
nurse O
practitioner O
to O
say O
I O
was O
stopping O
Lipitor O
and O
she O
was O
not O
really O
happy O
to O
put O
it O
mildly O
. O
I O
know O
my O
cholesterol B-DIS
will I-DIS
always I-DIS
be I-DIS
high I-DIS
, O
but O
after O
2 O
weeks O
off O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
feel O
better O
each O
day O
and O
know O
it O
's O
not O
my O
age O
causing O
the O
pain B-ADR
, O
high B-ADR

, O

off O

Ratios O
and O

have O
significantly O
improved O
and O
weight O
has O
dropped O
another O
15 O
lbs O
although O
LDL O
has O
gone O
up O
( O
probably O
due O
to O

in O

. O
Will O
retest O

out O

I O
would O
be O
very O
cautious O

My O

enough O
that O
I O
assumed O
I O
was O
relapsing O

I O
was O
astounded O
to O
find O
the O
problem O

Lipitor O

I O
had O
lesser O
problems O
with O
Pravachol O

have O
come O

overall O
OK O
if O

this O

the O

that O
works O

Helps O

My O
triglycerides O
and O
cholesterol O
were O
all O
normal O

healthy O
ranges O

before O
taking O
Lipitor O

But O
because O
of O
a O
high B-DIS
C I-DIS
-reactive I-DIS
protein I-DIS
level I-DIS
, O
I O
was O
prescribed O
Lipitor O
. O
After O
3 O
months O

My O
triglycerides O

total O

went O
down O

even O
though O
they O
were O
fine O

my O
CRP O

went O
UP O

From O
5.96 O

Since O
treating O
the O

the O

me O
Lipitor O

since O
it O
did O
NOTHING O
to O
help O
these O

I O
am O
therefore O
unsure O
if O
taking O
LIPITOR O

necessary O

let O
alone O

I O
Have O
been O

it O

I O
thought O
I O
was O
having O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
- O
went O
to O
emergency O
room O

Problem O
began O
while O
sitting O
at O
this O
computer O
. O
quick B-ADR
, I-ADR
sharp I-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
center I-ADR
of I-ADR

, O
followed O
by O
a O
hot B-ADR
/heated I-ADR
flushing I-ADR
sensation I-ADR
that I-ADR
began I-ADR
mid I-ADR
-torso I-ADR
and I-ADR
continued I-ADR
up I-ADR
to I-ADR
the I-ADR
top I-ADR
of I-ADR
head I-ADR
( I-ADR
top I-ADR
of I-ADR
scalp I-ADR
started I-ADR
tingling I-ADR
and I-ADR
burning I-ADR
) I-ADR
. O
Oddest O
feeling O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
ever O
experienced O
- O
very O
scary O
. O
Lasted O
approximately O
45 O
seconds O
, O
followed O
by O
feeling O
of O
weakness B-ADR
and O
impending B-ADR
doom I-ADR
. O
By O
the O
time O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
hospital O
I O
was O
shaking B-ADR
with I-ADR
chills I-ADR
uncontrollably I-ADR
. O
After O
tests O
were O
run O
I O
was O
told O
that O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
or O
stroke B-DIS
. O
They O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
related O
to O
stress B-DIS
or O
a O
panic B-DIS
attack I-DIS
-- O
ridiculous O
because O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
stressed B-DIS
and O
have O
never O
had O
any O
problem O
similar O
. O
Definitely O
helped O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
from O
263 O
to O
164 O
-- O
amazing O
, O
but O
I O
' O
m O
afraid O
to O
continue O
taking O
due O
to O
experiencing O
same O
severe O
side O
effects O
. O
Will O
discuss O
further O
with O
my O
doctor O

tell O
how O

it O
works O
when O
I O

the O
point O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
have O
to O
quit O
my O
job O
. O
This O
drug O
dramatically O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
but O
ruined O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
After O
repeated O
visits O
to O
my O
doctor O
complaining O
of O
these O
debilitating O
symptoms O
he O
finally O
made O
the O
connection O
and O
took O
me O
off O

Within O
3 O
days O

I O
started O

Cholesterol O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
brain O

nerve O
function O

is O
essential O
to O
our O
good O
overall O
health O
. O
Do O
your O
research O
. O
Stripping O
your O
body O
of O
it O
can O
be O
devastating O
. O
I O
would O
much O
rather O
take O
my O
chances O
with O
a O
slightly O
elevated O
level O
than O
go O
through O
that O
again O
. O
Horrible O
. O
Pfizer O
should O
be O
ashamed O
of O
themselves O
for O
not O
clearly O
stating O
the O
possibility O
of O
these O
side O
effects O
. O

Liver O

became O
elevated O
after O
taking O
the O
cholesterol O

medicines O
( O
Mevacor O
and O
Lipitor O
) O
for O
approximately O
9 O
years O
. O
The O
Lipitor O
was O
great O
at O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
and O
improving O
the O
ratio O
of O
my O
HDL O
's O
to O
LDL O
's O
; O
however O
, O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
my O
doctor O
I O
have O
discontinued O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
feeling O
well O
, O
until O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
now O
feel O
like O
my O
old O
self O
again O
. O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
explain O
, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
better O
sense O
of O
well O
-being O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
actually O
lost O
a O
few O
pounds O
even O
though O
I O
have O
not O
changed O
my O

. O
I O
feel O
less O
bloated B-ADR

and O
my O

feels O
more O
comfortable O

Excruciating B-ADR

After O

found O
this O

immediately O
stopped O

Waiting O
for O

After O
3 O

, O
I O
have O

Interestingly O
, O
my O
new O
doc O
took O
me O
off O
lipitor O
a O
week O
ago O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
severe O
medical O
problem O
like O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
, O
brain B-DIS
tumor I-DIS
, O
etc O
Within O
this O
week O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
has O
gone O
away O
. O
The O
tightening B-ADR
of I-ADR
neck I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
was O
causing O
headaches B-ADR
. O
I O
am O
now O
headache B-ADR
free O
! O
! O
Hope O
I O
continue O
to O
improve O
---will O
have O
to O
now O
address O

as O
it O
worked O
wonders O
with O
that O

I O
am O
writing O
this O
for O
my O

in I-ADR
right I-ADR

, O
symptoms B-ADR
of I-ADR
parkinson I-ADR

disease I-ADR
. O
since O
lipitor O
causes O
a O
decrease O
in O
coenzyme O
q10 O
and O
now O
there O
is O
a O
study O
in O
the O
archives O

showing O
that O
using O
large O
doses O
of O
coenzyme O
q10 O
slows O
the O
progression O
of O
parkinson B-DIS

disease I-DIS
, O
i O
wonder O
how O
many O
others O
have O
experienced O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
parkinson B-DIS
's I-DIS
having O
been O
on O
lipitor O
? O
we O
began O
questioning O
the O
role O
of O
lipitor O
in O
Parkinson B-DIS
's I-DIS
when O
my O
niece O
's O
husband O
who O
is O
57 O
was O
experiencing O
the O
same O
symptoms O
as O
my O
husband(the O
57 O
yr O
old O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Parkinson B-DIS
's I-DIS
2 O
weeks O
ago O
) O
and O
the O
major O
factor O
in O
common O
between O
the O
2 O
of O
them O
--Lipitor O
for O
4 O
+ O
yrs O
. O
not O
worth O
the O
risks O
of O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O
will O
now O
control O
cholesterol O
with O
diet O
and O
exercise O
. O

pronounced O
in O
the O
past O
few O
months O
( O
have O
taken O
Lipitor O
for O
3 O

) O
. O
Dr O
suggests O
side O
effects O
may O
be O
due O
to O
cumulative O
effect O
- O
will O
cease O
taking O

approx O
2 O

there O

especially O
in O
my O

I O
noticed O
that O
they O

about O
an O

after O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O

would O
continue O
for O
several O

into O
the O

. O
I O
was O
on O
Lipitor O
2 O

I O
noticed O
that O
on O
a O

that O
I O

that O
I O
did O

one O

then O
not O
taking O
it O
the O
next O
. O
Sure O
enough O
, O
every O
night O
I O
took O
the O

I O
had O
the O

the O
nights O
I O
did O

either O
I O
did O

experience O
the O

at O
all O
or O
it O
was O
at O
a O

After O
a O
few O
days O
, O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
2 O

period O
and O
noticed O
that O
all O
my O
symptoms O
improved O

the O
muscle B-ADR

completely O
resolved O
. O
I O
notified O

feel B-ADR
like I-ADR
shit I-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR

This O

before O
prescribed O
or O
better O
yet O
. O
take O
all O
the O
statin O
drugs O
off O
the O

. O
This O
drug O
is O
dangerous O
. O
I O
' O
m O
almost O
inspired O
to O
start O
my O
own O
web O
site O
to O
warn O
people O
of O
the O
risk O
in O
taking O
any O
statin O
drug O
for O
a O

Did O
n't O
associate O
my O
problems O
with O
Lipitor O
until O
reading O
this O
web O
site O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
about O
7 O
mos O
. O
Have O
had O
problems O
with O
my O
hips O
and O
knees O
in O
the O
past O
but O
just O
within O
the O
last O
year O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
experiencing O
spasms B-ADR
in I-ADR
upper I-ADR
thighs I-ADR
, O
especially O
after O
doing O
anything O
physical O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
a O
dr O
. O
appmt O
. O
in O
a O
few O
days O
because O
my O
right B-ADR
knee I-ADR
is I-ADR
so I-ADR
painful I-ADR
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
bend O
it O
! O
It O
hurts B-ADR
to I-ADR
get I-ADR
up I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
morning I-ADR
, I-ADR
get I-ADR
out I-ADR
of I-ADR
a I-ADR
chair I-ADR
, I-ADR
go I-ADR
up I-ADR
stairs I-ADR
. O
Also O
, O
I O
have O
had O
operations O
on O
my O
right B-ADR
foot I-ADR
a I-ADR
few I-ADR
years I-ADR
ago I-ADR
, I-ADR
but I-ADR
now I-ADR
it I-ADR
hurts I-ADR
almost O
as O
much O
if O
not O
more O
. O
The O
bottom B-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
foot I-ADR
is I-ADR
extremely I-ADR
tender I-ADR
as O
are O
my O
calves O
. O
The O
Lipitor O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
wonderfully O
; O
but O
I O
' O
m O
extremely O
concerned O
that O
this O
may O
be O
what O
my O
problems O
are O
coming O
from O
. O
Hopefully O
, O
the O
dr O
. O
will O
tell O
me O
more O
this O
week O
. O

Once O
I O
had O
bad O
nausea B-ADR
due O
to O
taking O
it O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
. O
Also O
causes O
bleeding B-ADR
problems I-ADR
. O
Stops O
migraine B-DIS
immediately O
when O
taken O
early O
on O
when O
all O
others O
did O
n't O

If O
I O
wait O
I O
have O

take O
two O
doses O
. O
Easy O
to O
take O
- O
a O
powder O
in O
a O
small O
amount O
of O

. O
It O
is O
an O
anti O

, O
not O
a O
hypnotic O
. O
My O
insurance O
only O
pays O
for O
4 O
doses O
a O
month O
, O
less O
than O
I O
need O
, O
and O
paying O
for O
it O
without O

is O
too O
expensive O

. O

cognitive B-ADR
ability I-ADR

slower I-ADR
and O
not O
uncommon O
to O
not B-ADR
be I-ADR
able I-ADR
to I-ADR
process I-ADR
thoughts I-ADR
. O
The O
best O
way O
to O
describe O
it O
would O
be O
to O
say O
that O
I O
notice O
that O
I O
am O
not B-ADR
as I-ADR
smart I-ADR
as I-ADR
I I-ADR
use I-ADR
to I-ADR
be I-ADR
. O
I O
no O
longer O
take O
it O
and O
I O
am O
smarter O
. O
I O
was O
only O
taking O

I O
will O
eventually O

now O
. O
It O
has O
truly O
been O
amazing O
how O
this O
drug O
has O
helped O
me O
. O

Sleeplessness B-ADR
, O
tingling B-ADR
in I-ADR
fingers I-ADR
. O
General O
foggy B-ADR
-headedness I-ADR
. O
Took O
the O
drug O
for O
several O
years O
before O
realizing O
that O
lipitor O
might O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
these O
symptoms O
. O
Stopped O
and O
started O
several O
times O
with O
recurring O
side O
-effects O
. O
Discontinued O
. O

After O
a O
routine O
check O
up O
my O
cholesterol B-DIS
level I-DIS
was I-DIS
found I-DIS
to I-DIS
be I-DIS
sky I-DIS
high I-DIS
. O
So O
two O
months O
ago O
the O
internist O
put O
me O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
. O
The O
lipitor O
helped O
in O
reducing O
the O
cholesterol O
level O
by O
20 O
% O
. O
The O
side O
effects O
were O
terrible O
! O
I O
had O
for O
a O
number O
of O
years O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
injoints I-ADR
. O
The O
lipitor O
increased O
the O
pain B-ADR
tenfold O
. O
I O
could O
hardly O
walk O
, O
sit O
or O
drive O
the O
car O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
experiencing I-ADR
especially I-ADR
around I-ADR
the I-ADR
injoints I-ADR
was O
incredible O
. O
I O
told O
the O
specialist O
about O
these O
side O
-effects O
and O
he O
told O
me O
to O
reduce O
the O
dose O
from O
1 O
a O
day O
to O
1 O
every O
two O
days O
! O
? O
I O
had O
already O
stopped O
taking O
the O
lipitor O
for O
a O
week O
and O
the O
pain B-ADR
had O
decreased O
somewhat O
. O
I O
learned O
from O
the O
pharmacist O
that O
this O
drug O
can O
cause O
wasting B-DIS
of I-DIS
muscles I-DIS
and O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
end O
up O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
because O
of O
it O
! O
! O
I O
am O
going O
to O
start O
on O
alternative O
medicines O
. O
I O
am O
never O
going O
to O
use O
this O
medicine O
again!. O

and O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
noted O
for O

This O
in O
turn O
has O
seriously B-ADR
upset I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
which O
the O
doctor O
prescribed O

another O
drug O

40 O

Lipitor O
worked O
well O
in O
reducing O
my O
overall O

levels O

which O
are O
high O
in O
my O
family O
. O
The O

all O

they O
can O
have O
it O
. O
Doctor O
took O
me O
off O

but O
I O
would O
have O
done O

myself O

Felt O

quite O
honestly O
! O
Thank O
GOD O
I O

this O

as O
all O
I O
could O
find O
on O
the O
web O
was O
how O
WONDERFUL O
Lipitor O
is O
! O
Maybe O
for O
some O
, O
but O
not O
for O
all O
of O
us O
obviously O
. O
. O

Stomach B-ADR

This O
medicine O
helped O
with O
the O
heel B-DIS

, O
however O
the O
side O
effects O
were O
far O
worse O
and O
not O
worth O
taking O
the O
medicine O
. O
I O
had O
bad B-ADR
gas I-ADR
and O
SEVERE B-ADR
diarrhea I-ADR
along O
with O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
nausea B-ADR

then O
muscle B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
, O
spasms B-ADR
, O
weakness B-ADR
in I-ADR
legs I-ADR
and O

progressed O

, O

, O

Stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
in O
April O
2006 O
and O
rapidly O
improved O
, O
but O
a O
month O
later O
started O
going O
downhill O
again O
and O
have O
now O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
ALS B-ADR
. O
I O
am O
an O
unlikely O
candidate O
for O
MND B-DIS
. O
I O
know O
the O
Lipitor O
poisoned O
me O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
stopped O
taking O
this O
poison O
before O
it O
caused O
permanent B-ADR
nerve I-ADR
damage I-ADR
. O

Taking O
80 O
mg O
. O
Really O
lowered O
my O
LDL O
to O
70 O
. O
Do O
n't O
feel O
better O
or O
worse O
on O
it O
but O
the O
angiogram O
was O
scary O
so O
I O
'll O
keep O
taking O
it O
until O
some O
real O
Drano O
comes O
along O
. O
Expensive O
out O
of O
pocket O
, O
though O
. O
And O
this O
is O
Canada O
. O

It O
either O
caused O
or O
gave O
me O
peripheral B-ADR
neuropathy I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
hands I-ADR
, I-ADR
arms I-ADR
, I-ADR
feet I-ADR
and I-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
And O
it O
damaged B-ADR
my I-ADR
liver I-ADR
. O
No O
one O
should O
ever O
take O
a O
statin O
. O
It O
should O
be O
taken O
off O
the O
market O
. O

I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor O
in O
Dec O
2009 O
. O
Experienced O
some O
leg B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
, O
but O
went O
away O
within O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O
In O
June O
, O
I O
ran O
out O
of O
my O
prescription O
, O
was O
busy O
, O
forgetful O
, O
stupid O
and O
did O
n't O
request O
a O
refill O
until O
about O
2 O
weeks O
later O
. O
It O
took O
another O
week O
to O
get O
the O
prescription O
because O
I O
had O
switched O
doctors O
and O
the O
pharmacy O
did O
n't O
follow O
up O
. O
Anyway O
, O
after O
3 O
weeks O
or O
so O
of O
not O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
started O
it O
again O

started O
having O
extreme B-DIS
muscle I-DIS
discomfort I-DIS
, O
achiness B-DIS
, O
cramps B-DIS
. O
I O
assumed O
it O
was O
due O
to O
my O
half O

training O
. O
I O
ran O
five O
miles O
last O
Saturday O
and O
expected O
to O

. O
But O
it O
has O
continued O
and O
gotten O
worse O
each O

and I-ADR
lower I-ADR
back I-ADR
. O
I O

why O
. O
I O
also O
have O
felt O
extremely B-ADR
fatigued I-ADR
and O
people O
are O

me O
I O
look O

I O
have O
pain B-ADR

my I-ADR
fingers I-ADR
as O
well O
as O
a O
major B-ADR
sharp I-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
side I-ADR
, O
which O
could O
be O
of O
of O
many O
things O
including O
simply O
gas B-ADR
- O
a O
common O
problem O
as O
reported O
here O
. O
Way O
too O
early O
to O
post O
something O
more O
constructive O
, O
but O
I O
will O
come O
back O
later O
. O
Thanks O
to O
all O

here O
- O
big O
relief O
from O
your O

to O

this O
is O
not O
unusual O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
miserable O
in O
my O
life O
. O
Started O
out O
with O
severe B-ADR
back I-ADR
spasms I-ADR
, O
then O
had O
intense B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR

all I-ADR
throughout I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
Weakness B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
right I-ADR
arm I-ADR
. O
The O
worst O
of O
all O
was O
feeling B-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
walking I-ADR
through I-ADR
waist I-ADR
-deep I-ADR
mud I-ADR
, O
I B-ADR
simply I-ADR
could I-ADR
not I-ADR
walk I-ADR
. O
Extreme B-ADR
anxiety I-ADR
as O
well O
. O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
an O
evil O
poison O
this O
is O
. O
My O
doctor O
never O
told O
me O
any O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
but O
since O
then O
I O
have O
learned O
of O
so O
many O
people O
with O
the O
same O
problems O
. O
Taking O
200 O
mg O
/day O
of O
COQ10 O
has O
helped O
immensely O
as O
well O
as O
the O
potassium O
of O
bananas O
. O

It O
concerns O
me O
that O
someone O
else O
is O
recommending O
SIMVASTATIN O
as O
an O
alternative O
to O
LIPITOR O
. O
Up O
until O
3 O
weeks O
ago O
I O
was O
taking O
IPEX O
which O
is O
SIMVASTATIN O
- O
it O
reduced O
my O

However O

over O

, O
the O

anybodies O

I O
am O
the O
advocate O
for O
my O
father O
who O
took O
this O
drug O
for O
8 O
months O
before O
he O
passed O
from O
an O
aggressive O
form O
of O
brain B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
in O
2005 O
. O
The O
patient O
data O
is O
reported O
for O
him O
by O
me O
. O
Briefly O
, O
my O
research O
during O
my O
advocacy O
efforts O
during O
his O
illness O
indicated O
that O
this O
drug O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
onset O
of O
his O
particular O
form O
of O
brain B-ADR
cancer I-ADR
( I-ADR
glial I-ADR
cell I-ADR
related I-ADR
cancer I-ADR
) I-ADR
. O
That O
cancer B-ADR
was O
diagnosed O
6 O
months O
after O
his O
initial O
Rx O
for O
Lipitor O
-- O
he O
died O
2 O
months O
after O
his O
initial O
cancer B-ADR
diagnosis O
. O
There O
were O
no O
warning O
signs O
, O
deterioration O
was O
very O
fast O
and O
debilitating O
-- O
he O
was O
a O
model O
totally O
healthy O
individual O
by O
conventional O
medical O
standards O
. O
My O
father O
was O
vibrant O
and O
could O
work O
any O
teen O
into O
the O
ground O
for O
a O
75 O
year O
old O
, O
had O
great O
cholesterol O
numbers O
, O
but O
he O
was O
a O
cardiac O
patient O
. O
He O
and O
the O
cardiologist O
agreed O
to O
go O
to O
Lipitor O
to O
see O
if O
they O
could O
drive O
LDL O
below O
100 O
( O
his O
lipid O
profile O
was O
very O
, O
very O
good O
by O
usual O
medical O
standards O
) O
. O
I O
will O
say O
that O
there O
was O
no O
way O
any O
doctor O
could O
have O
known O
this O
would O
happen O
( O
my O
research O
showed O
that O
Lipitor O
could O
contribute O
to O
this O
cancer O
with O
prior O
risk O
factors O
for O
it O
which O
would O
have O
to O
have O
been O
environmental O
exposure O
and O
from O
what O
I O
know O
of O
my O
father O
's O
work O
history O
experience O
) O
, O
but O
it O
would O
help O
if O
conventional O
medicine O
would O
listen O
to O
patients O
and O
their O
families O
about O
experiences O
that O
we O
all O
are O
reporting O
in O
places O
such O
as O
this O
. O
My O
father O
could O
not O
speak O
for O
himself O
as O
his O
form O
of O
brain B-ADR
cancer I-ADR
was O
so O
aggressive O
that O
he O
went O
from O
a O
totally O
normal O
guy O
walking O
with O
a O
cane O
from O
initial O
neurological B-ADR
damage I-ADR
at O
inital O

I O
started O
experiencing O
severe O
leg B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
at O
night O
with O
the O
pain B-ADR
traveling I-ADR
to I-ADR
my I-ADR
bundocks I-ADR
and I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
as O
well O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
Advil O
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinary B-ADR
tract I-ADR
infection I-ADR
( O
one O
of O
the O
side O
-effects O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-ADR
to I-ADR
urinate I-ADR
constantly O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
hamlet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
more O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
or O
urgency B-ADR
. O
I O
also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
lack B-ADR
of I-ADR
energy I-ADR
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
I O
attributed O
this O
to O
stress B-DIS
but O
after O
reading O
this O
website O
I O
feel O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
Lipitor O
also O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
will O
take O
this O
drug O
anymore O
and O
since O
I O
read O
that O
taking O
vitamin O
C O
can O
help O
you O
with O
your O
cholesterol O
I O
think O
I O
will O
try O
this O
method O
instead O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case O
-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

Took O
1 O
pill O
with O
dinner O
, O
woke O
during O
the O
night O
with O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
In O
the O
morning O
I O
discovered O
that O
I O
had O
bled B-ADR
heavily I-ADR
during O
the O
night O
. O
Bleeding B-ADR
continued O
the O
next O
day O
with O
clotting B-ADR
. O
Also O
developed O
a O
rash B-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
wrist I-ADR
. O
Discontinued O
use O
after O
one O
pill!!. O
After O
checking O
the O
web O
site O
and O
seeing O
the O
list O
of O
side O
effects O
for O
this O
medication O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
ever O
approved O
. O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
this O
medication O
for O
anyone O
. O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
reaction O
to O
any O
medication O
before O
. O
The O
complications O
of O
this O
drug O
outweight O
the O
benefits O
. O

I O
am O
female O
, O
age O
55 O
and O
generally O
in O
good O
health O
. O
No B-DIS
smoking I-DIS
or I-DIS
drinking I-DIS
and O
work O
daily O
. O
Wt O
is O
15 O
lbs O
more O
than O
it O
should O
be O
. O
Cholesterol B-DIS
has I-DIS
been I-DIS
high I-DIS
for O
years O
despite O
diet O
. O
Taking O
40 O
mg O
daily O
for O
1 O
year O
, O
took O
20 O
mg O
previously O
. O
Lately O
I O
realized O
everything B-ADR
hurts I-ADR
. O
It O
crept O
up O
on O
me O
. O
I O
am O
an O
RN O
and O
still O
did O
not O
put O
it O
together O
until O
this O
week O
when O
I O
decided O
something O
is O
not O
right O
. O
When O
the O
aches B-ADR
and I-ADR
pains I-ADR
were O
mild O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
arthritis B-DIS
or O
too O
much O
activity O
. O
Stopped O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
the O
generalized O
aches B-ADR
and I-ADR
pains I-ADR
are O
fading O
after O
just O
3 O
days O
. O
Will O
explore O
other O
options O
but O
these O
drugs O
have O
not O
been O
around O
long O
enough O
to O
confirm O
long O
term O
effects O
. O
Looking O
at O
this O
site O
, O
I O
will O
begin O
to O
ask O
my O
patients O
that O
are O
on O
statins O
about O
their O
history O
. O

muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
weakness I-ADR
, O
headaches B-ADR
, O
sleep B-ADR
disturbances I-ADR
. O
Have O
been O
on O
this O
drug O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
but O
for O
the O
last O
18 O
months O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
having O
problems B-ADR
with I-ADR
various I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
. O
Started O
with O
my O
SI O
joints O
. O
lots B-ADR
of I-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
there O
, O
very O
tight O
. O
Then O
my O
neck B-ADR
started I-ADR
getting I-ADR
stiff I-ADR
and O
the O
muscles B-ADR
are I-ADR
like I-ADR
boards I-ADR
they I-ADR
're I-ADR
so I-ADR
tight I-ADR
. O
Now O
the O
pain B-ADR
has I-ADR
gone I-ADR
into I-ADR
my I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
and I-ADR
upper I-ADR
arm I-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
side I-ADR
. O
Just O
last O
week O
I O
noticed O
my O
right B-ADR
arm I-ADR
is I-ADR
tight I-ADR
also O
. O
I O
ca B-ADR
n't I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
on I-ADR
either I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
now O
. O
My O
lower B-ADR
back I-ADR
is I-ADR
also I-ADR
tight I-ADR
again O
! O
And O
I O
get O
terrible B-ADR
headaches I-ADR
from O
the O
tight B-ADR
neck I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
. O
I O
googled O
muscle B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and O
Lipitor O
showed O
up O
on O
the O
first O
6 O
or O
7 O
entries O
! O
! O
I O
read O
all O
the O
comments O
on O
this O
page O
and O
could O
n't O
believe O
it O
! O
! O
I O
see O
my O
symptoms O
over O
and O
over O
! O
So O
, O
I O
had O
blood O
tests O
done O
this O
week O
and O
have O
elevated B-ADR
creatine I-ADR
so O
was O
told O
today O
to O
stop O
Lipitor O
immediately O
, O
and O
will O
see O
my O
doctor O
next O
week O
. O
After O
reading O
all O
these O
comments O
, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
Lipitor O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
this O
discomfort B-ADR
. O
I O
just O
hope O
and O
pray O
that O
I O
can O
recover O
from O
these O
terrible O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
will O
use O
vitamin O
C O
and O
other O
natural O
things O
to O
help O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
but O
if O
that O
does O
n't O
help O
. O
hey O
. O
I O
'd O
rather O
die O
from O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
than O
die O
a O
slow O
painful O
death O
on O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
think O
drugs O
are O
released O
on O
the O
market O
these O
days O
without O
enough O
long O
-term O
clinical O
studies O
to O
make O
sure O
they O
are O
safe O

I O

my O
Doctor O
did O

explain O
any O
risk O
to O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
although O
it O
lowered O
my O

some O
, O
I O
changed O
my O

started O
an O

I O
quit O
taking O
the O
drug O
2 O
months O
ago O
and O
have O
continually O
lowered O
my O
chol O

level O
. O

At O
about O
the O
same O
time O
as O
I O
started O
taking O
lipitor O
I O
began O
experiencing O
chest B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
soreness I-ADR
and O
spasms B-ADR
which O
have O
persisted O
. O
I O
now O
take O
neurontin O
, O
an O
anti O

drug O
together O
with O
pain O
killers O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
muscle B-ADR
problems I-ADR
. O
I O
have O
had O
three O
blood O
tests O
over O
time O
which O
indicate O
that O
the O
lipitor O
is O
not O
damaging O
the O
muscles O
. O
I O
remain O
suspicious O
that O
lipitor O
is O
contributing O
to O
my O
muscle B-ADR
problems I-ADR
( O
physiotherapist O
say O
there O
is O
other O
causes O
) O
but O
there O
is O
no O
denying O
that O
my O
cholesterol O
levels O
have O
been O
improved O
( O
they O
never O
were O
that O
bad O
) O
. O

Took O
one O
pill O
and O
20 O
minutes O
later O
had O
intense B-ADR
pelvic I-ADR
and I-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
Felt O
like O
a O

( O
I O
' O

. O
This O
intense B-ADR

horrid I-ADR

lasted O
1.5 O

Then O
I O
had O

it O
may O
be O
due O

However O

I O
' O
ve O

Some O
for O

However O
, O
I O
did O

have O
side O

from O
any O
of O
those O
medications O
. O
When O
I O
started O
Lipitor O
, O
Immediately O
had O
lower B-ADR

, O
then O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
thighs I-ADR
( I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
) I-ADR
. O
It O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
matter O
what O
foods O
I O
eat O
, O
I O
always O
get O
distention B-ADR
and O
gas B-ADR
while O
on O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
an O
unpleasant O
( O
for O
everyone O
near O
me O
) O
side O
effect O
. O
Since O
my O
Dr O
is O
out O
of O
town O
, O
and O
I O
' O
ve O
only O
been O
on O
the O
medication O
for O
6 O
weeks O
( O
10 O
mg O
) O
, O
I O
' O
m O
stopping O
it O
until O
I O
get O
in O
to O
see O
her O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
also O
had O
very O
different O
cholesterol O
readings O
over O
the O
years O
, O
and O
am O
skeptical O
that O
any O
given O
time O
you O
go O
in O
for O
a O
blood O
test O
, O
it O
could O
be O
very O
different O
. O
It O
's O
just O
that O
my O
last O
one O
was O
high O
( O
275 O
! O
) O
But O
sometimes O
it O
's O
170 O
. O
And O
it O
's O
also O
been O
borderline O
for O
many O
years O
, O
around O
200 O
. O
( O
with O
the O
good O
cholesterol O
very O
good O
) O
. O
I O
think O
it O
's O
higher O
these O
days O
, O
because O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
in O
menopause B-DIS
longer O
. O
But O
I O
wonder O
if O
side O
effects O
to O
any O
drug O
are O
n't O
a O
message O
that O

WHAT O
THE O

After O
taking O
my O
first O
pill O
, O
I O
quickly O
experienced O
extreme O
uterine B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
. O
It B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
having I-ADR
a I-ADR
baby I-ADR
and O
broke O
out O
in O
a O
cold B-ADR
sweat I-ADR
, I-ADR
shaking I-ADR
uncontrollably I-ADR
, O
nauseated B-ADR
, O
several B-ADR
bowel I-ADR

I B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR
going I-ADR
to I-ADR
pass I-ADR
out I-ADR
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
welcomed O
after O
feeling O
what O
I O
felt O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
subsided O
fortunately O
within O
15 O
minutes O
, O
but O
now O
this O
morning O
I O
have O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
and I-ADR
I I-ADR
am I-ADR
only I-ADR
11 I-ADR
days I-ADR
into I-ADR
my I-ADR
cycle I-ADR
. O
Do O
not O

unless O
you O
are O
prepared O
to O
deal O
with O
gut B-ADR
wrenching I-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
going B-ADR
into I-ADR
shock I-ADR
. O
Not O
worth O
it O
, O
I O
will O
continue O
to O
take O
Ibuprofen O

slightly B-ADR
heavier I-ADR

An O
absolute O
miracle O
drug O
for O
me O
. O
None O
of O
the O
stomach B-DIS
issues I-DIS
others O
seem O
to O
have O
. O
I O
was O
at O
the O
point O
where O
I O
was O
becoming O
highly B-DIS
immobile I-DIS
and O
in O
constant B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
Started O
taking O
arthritic O
and O
had O
IMMEDIATE O
relief O
. O
honestly O
never O
thought O
I O
would O
feel O
that O
way O
again O
. O
recently O
pain B-DIS
has O
started O
to O
increase O
though O
, O
and O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
' O
ve O
overworked O
my O
back O
. O
or O
if O
I O
' O
m O
becoming O
intolerant O
. O
Have O
recommended O
to O
two O
others O
who O
have O
had O
similar O
exceptional O
results O
for O
chronic B-DIS
arthritic I-DIS
type I-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O

For O
about O
15 O
months O
I O
experienced O
SEVERE B-ADR
fatigue I-ADR
, O
and O
initially O
for O
about O
three O
months O
very B-ADR
bad I-ADR
headaches I-ADR
which O
diminished O
in O
intensity O
but O
never O
completely O
went O
away O
. O
Insomnia B-ADR
, O
I O
would O
wake O
up O
at O
3:00 O
am O
and O
be O
unable O
to O
go O
back O
to O
sleep O
. O
Difficulty B-ADR
in I-ADR
swallowing I-ADR
and O
constipation B-ADR
. O
I O
went O
to O
3 O
different O
doctors O
for O
these O
symptoms O
. O
All O
of O
them O
dismissed O
my O
view O
that O
maybe O
the O
Lipitor O
was O
causing O
all O
of O
this O
even O
though O
the O
symptoms O
started O
about O
3 O
weeks O
after O
using O
the O
dosage O
from O
20 O
mg O
. O
to O
40 O
. O
I O
quit O
taking O
Lipitor O
about O
a O
week O
ago O
- O
thanks O
in O
part O
to O
this O
web O
site O
. O
Within O
3 O
days O
I O
was O
no O
longer O
consistently O
waking O
up O
at O
3:00 O
am O
unable O
to O
go O
back O
to O
sleep O
. O
Headaches B-ADR
seem O
to O
be O
dissipating O
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
extreme B-ADR
fatigue I-ADR
is O
disappearing O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
expect O
MD O
's O
to O
be O
knowledgeable O
about O
every O
drug O
and O
I O
recognize O
that O
this O
drug O
has O
probably O
saved O
a O
lot O
of O
lives O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
attitude O
that O
I O
find O
irresponsible O
, O
that O
these O
problems O
could O
n't O
possibly O
be O
caused O
by O
Lipitor O
since O
as O
all O
the O
doctors O
said O
. O

hair B-ADR
fell I-ADR
out I-ADR
, O
insomnia B-ADR
, O
areas B-ADR
of I-ADR
fat I-ADR
under I-ADR
the I-ADR
skin I-ADR
became I-ADR
sore I-ADR
to I-ADR
the I-ADR
touch I-ADR
, O
last B-ADR
straw I-ADR
was I-ADR
ringing I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
ears I-ADR
. O
I O
took O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
daily O
for O
about O
5 O
months O
. O
It O
did O
a O
fantastic O
job O
of O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
and O
improving O
the O
good O
/bad O
ratio O
. O
Eventually O
, O
the O
insomnia B-ADR
, O
and O
the O
ringing B-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
ears I-ADR
( I-ADR
tinnitus I-ADR
) I-ADR
caused O
me O
to O
stop O
it O
. O
After O
2 O
months O
on O
nothing O
I O
tried O
5 O
mg O
of O
Crestor O
( O
one O
dose O
) O
, O
and O
had O
to O
lie O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
heating O
pad O
on O
my O
legs O
for O
the O
aching B-ADR
it I-ADR
caused I-ADR
( I-ADR
like I-ADR
the I-ADR
flu I-ADR
) I-ADR
. O
I O
know O
many O
people O
who O
tolerate O
statin O
drugs O
without O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
for O
me O
, O
it O
's O
just O
not O
worth O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
wo O
n't O
try O
again O
. O

One O
hour O
after O
taking O
Arthritic O
, O
I O
experienced O
the O
sudden O
onset O
of O
severe B-ADR
menstrual I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
on O
the O
birth O
control O
pill O
and O
should O
not O
have O
my O
period O
for O
another O
3 O
weeks O
. O
I O
am O
in O
so B-ADR
much I-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
I O
can O
not O
sleep O
, O
nor O
can O
I O
take O
Advil O
for O
the O
pain O
as O
it O
is O
also O
an O
NSAID O
. O
The O
patient O
warning O
indicates O
that O
this O
drug O
can O
cause O
an O
abortion B-DIS
. O
I O
wish O
I O
'd O
read O
my O
entire O
monograph O
before O
taking O
the O
tablet O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
for O
women O
prior O
to O
menopause B-DIS
. O
Nor O
sure O
why O
my O
doctor O
thought O
it O
would O
help O
my O
endo B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O

Numbness B-ADR
started I-ADR
in I-ADR
left I-ADR
toe I-ADR
& I-ADR
went I-ADR
to I-ADR
right I-ADR
toe I-ADR
then I-ADR
went I-ADR
to I-ADR
all I-ADR
toes I-ADR
. O
Burning B-ADR
feet I-ADR
especially O
at O
night O
. O
I O
was O
on O
Lipitor O
about O
2 O
years O
when O
this O
started O
. O
It O
went O
to O
all O
of O
my O
feet O
. O
My O
dr O
wanted O
to O
keep O
me O
on O
lipitor O
but O
when O
I O
quit O
taking O
I O
got O
better O
gradually O
. O
I O
really O
had O
to O
fight O
my O
dr O
to O
get O
him O
to O
believe O
that O
lipitor O
was O
causing O
this O
. O
He O
put O
me O
on O
another O
statin O
after O
a O
month O
of O
not O
taking O
Lipitor O
and O
the O
same O
thing O
started O
to O
happen O
. O
I O
am O
now O
taking O
herbs O
for O
my O
cholesterol O
and O
it O
is O
still O
high O
but O
going O
lower O
and O
my O
feet O
are O
doing O
better O
. O
Drug O
co O
should O
inform O
doctors O
of O
these O
problems O
so O
they O
will O
understand O
them O
when O
their O
patients O
come O
to O
them O
for O
help O
and O
. O
I O
found O
that O
all O
statins O
cause O
this O
problem O
and O
the O
drug O
companies O
should O
help O
rather O
than O
hide O
the O
problems O
. O

Severe B-ADR
leg I-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
weakness B-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
in I-ADR
legs I-ADR
, I-ADR
feet I-ADR
, I-ADR
arms I-ADR
, I-ADR
ribs I-ADR
, I-ADR
face I-ADR
. O
I O
went O
from O
being O
a O
normal O
, O
active O
46 O
year O
old O
male O
doing O
my O
job O
and O
normal O
activities O
of O
life O
until O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
took O
20 O
mg O
. O
for O
approximately O
1 O
year O
, O
then O
started O
noticing O
the O
muscle B-ADR
problems I-ADR
so O
I O
discontinued O
it O
. O
That O
was O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
I O
am O
still O
having O
severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
weakness I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, I-ADR
especially I-ADR
the I-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
I O
can B-ADR
barely I-ADR
make I-ADR
it I-ADR
up I-ADR
one I-ADR
flight I-ADR
of I-ADR
stairs I-ADR
to O
get O
to O
my O
office O
at O
work O
. O
Have O
no O
social O
activities O
now O
, O
ca O
n't O
even O
stand O
to O
fish O
anymore O
. O
I O
regret O
the O
day O
I O
ever O
took O
a O
statin O
drug O
and O
will O
warn O
everyone O
I O
talk O
to O
about O
the O
devastating O
effects O
of O
these O
drugs O
. O

Diarrhea B-ADR
after O
only O
one O
pill O
. O
Unbearable O
after O
two O
. O
I O
stopped O
after O
2 O
days O
, O
waited O
2 O
weeks O
and O
tried O
again O
. O
Same O
results O
. O
I O
have O
lots O
of O
food O
and O
chemical O
sensitivities O
, O
so O
I O
' O
m O
sure O
this O
is O
not O
a O
typical O
response O
. O

I O
used O
to O
take O
Pravachol O
( O
sp?)but O
I O
found O
it O
caused O
extreme B-ADR
bloating I-ADR
. O
It O
also O
seem O
to O
increase B-ADR
my I-ADR
heart I-ADR
rate I-ADR
therefore O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
well I-ADR
. O
I O
requested O
to O
take O
Lipitor O
( O
10 O
mg O
) O
. O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
it O
for O
about O
three O
months O
now O
. O
I O
will O
go O
for O
a O
blood O
test O
within O
a O
few O
days O
so O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
good O
it O
did O
its O
job O
. O
As O
far O
as O
side O
effects O
are O
concerned O
, O
I O
find O
that O
Lipitor O
also O
causes O
bloating B-ADR
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
gas B-ADR
build O
up O
although O
not O
as O
badly O
as O
my O
previous O
medication O
. O
I O
' O
m O
finding O
it O
difficult O
to O
fit O
into O
my O
clothes O
due O
to O
the O
bloating B-ADR
. O
I O
also O
find O
that O
it O
makes O
me O
a O
bit O
drowsy B-ADR
, O
almost O
like O
a O
sleeping O
pill O
. O
I O
therefore O
take O
it O
at O
bedtime O
but O
my O
sleep B-ADR
is I-ADR
not I-ADR
very I-ADR
sound I-ADR
and O
therefore O
not O
refreshing O
. O
I O
developed O
a O
pain B-ADR
that I-ADR
seems I-ADR
to I-ADR
originate I-ADR
at I-ADR
the I-ADR
base I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
neck I-ADR
, O
travel O
down O
to O
my O
shoulder O
blades O
and O
then O
run O
to O
my O
shoulders O
, O
elbow O
and O
wrist O
. O
I O
first O
attributed O
this O
to O
work O
stress O
because O
I O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
computer O
work O
. O
I O
thought O
perhaps O
that O
I O
was O
getting O
tendonitis B-DIS
looking O
at O
th O
. O
I O
have O
begun O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
fighting O
back O
against O
the O
side O
effects O
and O
have O
been O
taking O
multivitamins O
, O
B O
complex O
, O
coq10 O
, O
and O
gas O
for O
bloating B-ADR
. O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
today O
is O
the O
first O
day O
in O
months O
that O
I O
have O
felt O
really O
well O
. O
very O
little O
gas B-ADR
, O
almost O
no O
pain B-ADR
. O
I O
'll O
keep O
tabs O
on O
this O
and O
will O
report O
back O
on O
my O
ldh O
levels O
. O
My O
father O
used O
to O
take O
this O
drug O
and O
he O
also O
experienced O
bloating B-ADR
and O
gas B-ADR
. O
He O
took O
Tums O
to O
alluviate O
stomach B-ADR
upsets I-ADR
and O
also O
cut O
his O
Lipitor O
dose O
in O
half O
. O

Blurry B-ADR
vision I-ADR
. O
bad B-ADR
balance I-ADR
. O

extreme B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
spasms I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
lower I-ADR
back I-ADR
, O
eye B-ADR
sight I-ADR
changes I-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
and O
weakness B-ADR
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
drug O
almost O
two O
weeks O
ago O
and O
my O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
is O
beginning O
to O
go O
away O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
drug O
even O
though O
it O
did O
work O
to O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
. O

Severe O
skin B-ADR
rash I-ADR
to O
my O
upper O
thighs O
. O
The O
itch B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
is O
unbearable O
to O
the O
point O
you O
ca B-ADR
nt I-ADR
sleep I-ADR

bear O
to O
wear O
your O

, O

, O
peripheral B-ADR
neuropathy I-ADR
. O
. O
. O
I O
took O
Lipitor O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
9 O
months O
before O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
connection O
after O
a O
myriad O
of O
tests O
showed O
no O
other O
reason O
for O
my O
array O
of O
symptoms O
. O
Since O
then O
, O
I O
have O
done O
extensive O
research O
on O
statins O
and O
would O
warn O
anybody O
on O
them O
to O
watch O
out O
. O
Make O
sure O
you O
take O
supplemental O
coq-10 O
along O
with O
a O
statin O
. O
If O
you O
start O
to O
have O
any O
muscle B-DIS
problems I-DIS
, O
quit O
the O
drug O
while O
you O
still O
have O
a O
chance O
. O
My O
life O
has O
been O
changed O
completely O
for O
the O
worse O
and O
I O
will O
probably O
never O
completely O
recover O
from O
the O
damage O
caused O
by O
Lipitor O
. O

This O
med O
worked O
wonders O
for O
me O
. O
Am O
only O
gratefully O
to O
the O
pharmaceutical O
company O
that O
makes O
it O
. O
My O
lipids O
are O
at O
normal O
level O
in O
the O
past O
2 O
H1C O
tests O
. O
As O
diabetic B-DIS
you O
are O
at O
higher O
risk O
for O
stroke B-DIS
and O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
so O
taking O
Lipitor O
definitely O
lowers O
the O
risk O
. O
No O
side O
effects O
. O
Expensive O
medicine O
but O
luckily O
my O
insurance O
covers O
it O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
4 O
years O
and O
was O

of O
the O

the O

did O
not O

I O
now O
know O

that O
it O
takes O
longer O

then O
a O
few O

This O

After O

out I-ADR

bed I-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
morning I-ADR
or I-ADR
walk I-ADR
up I-ADR
stairs I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
depressed B-ADR
that O
. O
I O
realized O
that O
I O
felt O
better O
in O
the O
late O
afternoon O
and O
evening O
. O
I O
had O
been O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
at O
night O
. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
knew O
that O
its O
effects O
were O
wearing O
off O
at O
that O
time O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
stopped O
it O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
feel O
100 O
% O
better O
. O
Very O
scary O
drug O
. O

After O
being O
on O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
, O
I O
started O
to O
experience O
speech B-ADR
and I-ADR
swallowing I-ADR
problems I-ADR
which O
got O
worse O
while O
I O
continued O
to O
take O
it O
as O
recommended O
by O
my O
physician O
. O
After O
6 O
months O
, O
my O
speech B-ADR
and I-ADR
swallowing I-ADR
were I-ADR
so I-ADR
bad I-ADR
that O
I O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
It O
is O
now O
one O
year O
after O
stopping O
and O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
ALS B-DIS
( O
which O
tests O
later O
verified O
was O
incorrect O
) O
and O
I O
think O
that O
I O
am O
beginning O
to O
improve O
in O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
. O
but O
very O
slowly O
and O
I O
may O
never O
get O
back O
to O
where O
I O
was O
before O
Lipitor O
. O
It O
has O
also O
affected B-ADR
my I-ADR
memory I-ADR
. O
Had O
Pfizer O
just O
mentioned O
in O
their O
precautions O
that O
Lipitor O
just O
might O
cause O
speech B-ADR
and I-ADR
swallowing I-ADR
problems I-ADR
, O
I O
would O
have O
stopped O
taking O
statin O
drugs O
6 O
months O
earlier O
and O
I O
would O
have O
been O
OK O
again O
. O

Heartburn B-ADR
and O
stomach B-ADR
upset I-ADR
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
pretty O
well O
. O
I O
still O
have O
pain B-DIS
but O
less O
severe O
. O
I O
have O
been O
somewhat O
concerned O
about O
taking O
this O
drug O
for O
so O
long O
due O
to O
the O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
my O
Dr O
checks O
me O
out O
( O
blood O
work O
, O
etc O
) O
every O
four O
months O
and O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
doing O
albright O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
started O
on O
stronger O
, O
possibly O
habit O
forming O
drugs O
. O

Maintains O
my O

For O
as O
long O
as O
I O
could O
remember O
I O
' O
ve O
always O
had O
perfect O
cholesterol O
( O
from O
a O
percentage O
perspective O
anyway O
) O
. O
It O
's O
always O
been O
right O
around O
120/120 O
. O
For O
what O
ever O
reason O
my O
LDL O
shot O
up O
to O
175 O
so O
a O
( O
not O
my O
normal O
one O
) O
Dr O
just O
prescribed O
me O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
any O
problems O
for O
just O
over O
2 O
months O
then O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
one O
day O
I O
stared O
feeling B-ADR
horrible I-ADR
like I-ADR
a I-ADR
severe I-ADR
flu I-ADR
just I-ADR
hit I-ADR
me I-ADR
. O
For O
the O
next O
few O
days O
I O
could B-ADR
n't I-ADR
get I-ADR
enough I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
I O
was B-ADR
incredibly I-ADR
week I-ADR
and O
had B-ADR
pains I-ADR
throughout I-ADR
my I-ADR
upper I-ADR
body I-ADR
. O
I O
saw O
my O
regular O
Dr O
and O
decided O
to O
stop O
taking O
the O
drug O
, O
she O
also O
drew O
blood O
. O
Luckily O
most O
of O
the O
tests O
came O
back O
normal O
but O
there O
was O
a O
small O
spike O
in O
something O
with O
my O
liver O
which O
was O
normal O
before O
. O
My O
Cholesterol O
was O
LDL O
95 O
HDL O
109 O
( O
which O
I O
thought O
it O
is O
advertised O
to O
raise O
? O
) O
and O
my O
triglycerides O
were O
great O
as O
well O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
the O
drug O
does O
n't O
work O
but O
compared O
to O
how O
I O
feel O
it O
's O
not O
with O
it O
and O
I O
'll O
never O
take O
it O
again O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
off O
it O
for O
3 O
days O
now O
and O
only O
feel O
slightly O

after O

I O

I O

it O

I O
first O

Now O
after O
getting O
the O

when O
we O
doubled O
the O
dosage O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O

the O

a O

told O
me O
that O
her O
supposedly O
' O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
' O
disappeared O
when O
she O
stopped O
the O

Too O
many O
people O

all O
the O

prescribed O

It O
did O
lower O
my O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
cripple B-DIS

Now O
I O
eat O

weekly O
, O
watch O
my O

It O
does O
lower O
my O

300 O
to O
175 O
I O
stopped O
it O
for O
1 O
month O
my O

went O
up O

I O
suggest O
people O
with O
high B-DIS

research O
more O
about O

all O

I O

I O
would O
not O

I O

considerably O

I O

about O
a O
year O

when O
I O
started O
lipitor O

Recently O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
I O
could O
not O
do O
a O

up O

severe O

Playing O

The O

in I-ADR
my I-ADR

I O
thought O
that O
I O
was O
just O

out O

it O
might O
be O
the O
lipitor O

I O

going O
off O
the O

trying O

Perhaps O
the O

slower O
because O

We O

The O
worst O
thing O
about O
this O
insidious O
drug O
was O
that O
I O
did O
not O
realize O
how O
badly O
it O
was O

me O
! O
Thought O
that O
this O
was O
how O

all O

Once O
I O
stopped O
Lipitor O
, O
side O
effects O
went O
away O
gradually O
. O
I O
had O
a O
similar O
reaction O
recently O
to O
Tricot O
, O
another O
cholesterol O
lowering O
medication O
. O
Had O
similar O
muscle O
and O
joint O
pains O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
off O
of O
that O
. O

After O
only O
3 O
weeks O
on O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
I O
called O
my O
Dr O
to O
discontinue O
. O
I O
have O
recently O
begun O
a O
workout O
regimen O
6 O
days O
a O
week O
doing O
elliptical O
training O
and O
weight O
training O
. O
After O
workouts O
I O
would O
be O
so O
tired O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
was O
going O
to O
bed O
at O
8 O
pm O
( O
I O
' O
m O
normally O
a O
night O
-owl O
) O
. O
I O
was O
mostly O
feeling O
drained B-ADR
and I-ADR
tired I-ADR
which O
was O
unusual O
for O
me O
and O
did O
n't O
feel O
that O
way O
previous O
to O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
have O
also O
experienced O
tingling B-ADR
or O
a O
sense O
of O
my O
hand B-ADR
being I-ADR
asleep I-ADR
( O
example O
: O
if O
you O
lay O
on O
it O
wrong O
and O
it O
's O
numb B-ADR
-like I-ADR
) O
. O
I O
have O
only O
been O
off O
one O
day O
. O
but O
have O
already O
slept O
better O
than O
I O
had O
in O
the O
3 O
wks O
on O
it O
. O
Do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
worked O
to O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
since O
I O
was O
n't O
on O
it O
for O
the O
6 O
wks O
to O
do O
the O
bloodworm O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
to O
lower O
it O
naturally O
through O
exercise O
and O
diet O
instead O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
not O
sure O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
Stay O
in O
tune O
with O
your O
body O
. O
I O
elected O
to O
discontinue O
immediately O
with O
onset O
of O
side O
effects O
. O
Will O
consider O
other O
alternatives O
. O

I O
have O
no O
side O
effects O
that O
I O
am O
aware O
of O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
various O
pain O
meds O
for O
the O
shoulder O
and O
nothing O
worked O
. O
I O
was O
skeptical O
when O
my O
doctor O
asked O
me O
to O
try O
Arthritic O
but O
my O
pain B-DIS
is O
totally O
under O
control O
without O
any O
apparent O
side O
effects O
. O

after O
taking O
just O
one O
dose O
, O
had O
hunger B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
and O
stomach B-ADR
cramping I-ADR
, O
in O
the O
eve O
and O
through O
the O
night O
constant O
muscle B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
calf I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, O
could B-ADR
n't I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
, O
had O
to O
keep O
jumping O
out O
of O
bed O
because O
of O
the O
cramps B-ADR
. O
I O
just O
went O
for O
test O
and O
have O
n't O
gotten O
results O
yet O
, O
but O
Dr O
feels O
I O
have O
more O
than O
1 O
form O
of O
arthritis B-DIS
, O
I O
also O
have O
a O
very O
sensitive O
stomach O
, O
this O
is O
cheaper O
and O
more O
approved O
by O
health O
insurance O
, O
so O
that O
is O
why O
this O
prescribed O
. O
Seems O
to O
me O
we O
always O
have O
to O
choose O
lesser O
of O
the O
2 O
evils O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O

my O

some O

it O

Still O

stated O
my O

all O

side O
effects O
. O
After O
trying O
Zocor O
, O
Pravachol O
, O

, O
Lipitor O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
lessor O
of O
the O
evils O
with O
regard O

. O
However O
, O
due O
to O
heart B-DIS
problems I-DIS
, O
cardiologist O
gradually O
increased O
the O
Lipitor O
dosage O
from O
10 O

Symptoms O

been O

After O
reading O
your O
comments O
regarding O

I O
have O
decided O
to O
reduce O
the O
dosage O
from O
40 O
mg O
to O
20 O
mg O
for O
a O
week O
to O
see O
if O
this O
relieves O
the O
most O
recent O

If O
improvement O

noted O

then O
I O
will O
contact O
my O

for O
a O
further O
reduction O
in O
the O
dosage O

determine O
if O
other O

abate O

I O

it O

the O

relatives O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
cognitive B-DIS
impairments I-DIS
are O
really O
suffering O
from O
statin O
side O
effects O
. O
The O
drug O
companies O
have O
certainly O
done O
a O
number O
on O
the O
American O
public O
. O

Fatigue B-ADR
, O
Brain B-ADR
Fog I-ADR
, O
Stuttering B-ADR
, O
Bad B-ADR
OCD!. O
I O
am O
diabetic B-DIS
and O
my O
numbers O
were O
n't O
horrible O
but O
they O
want O
you O
below O
100 O
- O
this O
drug O
and O
the O
statins O
they O
tried O
on O
me O
were O
not O
worth O
it O
at O
all O
. O

I O
female O
, O
5 O
feet O
7 O
and O
a O
half O
inches O
tall O
, O
117 O
lbs O
. O
I O
do B-DIS
not I-DIS
smoke I-DIS
and I-DIS
have I-DIS
never I-DIS
smoked I-DIS
. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
high B-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
, O
nor O
have O
I O
ever O
had O
it O
. O
I O
am O
not O
diabetic B-DIS
. O
I O
am O
45 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
old O
and O
was O
on O
20 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
due O
to O
genetically B-DIS
high I-DIS
LDL I-DIS
for O
a O
period O
of O
seven O
months O
. O
At O
that O
point O
, O
I O
started O
having O
terrible B-ADR
, I-ADR
migratory I-ADR
joint I-ADR
pain I-ADR
all I-ADR
over I-ADR
my I-ADR
body I-ADR
that O
was O
very O
distinct O
and O
pronounced O
. O
I O
also O
had O
disabling B-ADR
fatigue I-ADR
and O
flu B-ADR
-like I-ADR
malaise I-ADR
. O
Some O
nights O
I O
would O
go O
to O
bed O
at O
6 O
pm O
and O
not O
get O
up O
until O
8 O
or O
9 O
the O
next O
morning O
. O
I O
was O
quite B-ADR
ill I-ADR
. O
My O
doctor O
did O
tons O
of O
lab O
work O
to O
rule O
out O
things O
like O
rheumatoid B-DIS
arthritis I-DIS
, O
lupus B-DIS
, O
Lyme B-DIS
disease I-DIS
and O
active B-DIS
parvovirus I-DIS
infection I-DIS
. O
These O
all O
came O
back O
NEGATIVE O
. O
Finally O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
off O
Lipitor O
to O
see O
if O
the O
drug O
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
my O
symptoms O
. O
Within O
72 O
hours O
I O
noted O
an O
improvement O
; O
within O
seven O
days O
, O
the O
symptoms O
were O
completely O
gone O
and O
I O
was O
restored O
to O
health O
. O
I O
will O
not O
ever O
take O
Lipitor O
again O
as O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
liver O
-toxic O
and O
slowly O
poisons O
the O
patient O
. O
It O
did O
a O
great O
job O
of O
lowering O
my O
LDL O
( O
173 O
down O
to O
60 O
) O
. O
My O
total O
cholesterol O
went O
from O
238 O
down O
to O
143 O
. O
However O
, O
it O
nearly O
killed O
me O
in O
the O
process O
and O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
almost O
like O
a O
slow O
-acting O
poison O
. O

Experienced O
excruciating B-ADR
, I-ADR
unusual I-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
pain I-ADR
( O
bowel O
, O
uterine O
) O
and O
lower B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
for O
about O
5 O
hours O
after O
taking O
( O
including O

6 O
times O
) O
, O
and O
heart B-ADR
palpitations I-ADR
and O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
for O
about O
a O
day O
after O
taking O
. O
I O
took O
with O
2 O
aspirin O
( O
which O
I O
' O
ve O
since O
learned O
is O
contraindicated O
) O
and O
some O
fruit O
. O
This O
may O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
problems O
in O
my O
case O
. O
I O
will O
not O
take O
it O
again O
as O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
extreme O
, O
but O
others O
should O
be O
cautious O
to O
take O
with O
lots O
of O
food O
and O
no O
aspirin O
. O

Does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
giving O
me O
negative O
side O
effects O
. O
My O
ordeal O
began O
with O
leg B-DIS
problems I-DIS
long O
before O
my O
bypass O
and O
any O
drugs O
were O
taken O
. O
After O
surgery O
I O
was O
given O
list O
of O
drugs O
of O
which O
Lipitor O
was O
one O
. O
I O
take O
80mg./day O
at O
night O
along O
with O
aspirin O
, O
100 O
mg O
of O
Atenolol O
and O
a O

of O
others O
. O
Sorry O
to O
say O
my O
leg B-DIS
pains I-DIS
have O
not O
went O
away O
, O
and O
by O
reading O
many O
of O
these O
postings O
it O
appears O
to O
exaggerate O
this O
condition O
. O
Doctors O
looking O
elsewhere O
but O
have O
found O
nothing O
. O
I O
found O
information O
about O
leg B-DIS
pains I-DIS
being O
caused O
by O
restless B-DIS
leg I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
. O
I O
sure O
hope O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
! O
Started O
at O
262 O
, O
after O
8 O
months O
down O

that O
would O
not O
go O
away O
UNTIL O
I O
stopped O
taking O
lipitor O
. O
I O
put O
up O
with O
this O
for O
2 O
years O
until O
I O
realized O
the O
medication O
could O
have O
caused O
it O
and O
stopped O
- O
things O
cleared O
up O
IMMEDIATELY O
. O
would O
prefer O
to O
try O

will O
NEVER O

Taking O
the O
drug O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
and O
after O
9 O
years O
my O
liver O
enzyme O
tests O
suddenly O
were O
in O
a O
good O
range O
. O
I O
believe O
a O
good O
diet O
can O
do O
more O
for O
me O
than O
Lipitor O
. O

ldl O
is O
still O
too O
high O
. O
Dr O
has O
added O

and O
I O
will O
switch O
to O

have O

feeling I-ADR
that O
wo O
n't O
go O
away O
before O
or O
after O
eating O
. O

I O
was O
taking O
Celebret O
until O
ineffective O
, O
then O
Vivax O
, O
then O
Lodine O
, O
and O
now O
Arthritic O
. O
I O
realize O
that O
a O
knee O
replacement O
is O
inevitable O
, O
and O
I O
need O
the O
medication O
, O
but O
the O
stomach B-ADR
pains I-ADR
are O
aggravating O
although O
bearable O
. O

I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O
lipitor O
, O
but O
shortly O
after O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
, O
I O
experienced O
complete O
paralysis B-ADR
in O
my O
forehead O
( O
peripheral B-ADR
neuropathy I-ADR
) O
. O
Went O
to O
a O
neurologist O
, O
GP O
and O
ENT O
, O
none O
of O
whom O
have O
ever O
seen O
this O
kind O
of O
paralysis B-ADR
( O
both O
sides O
) O
with O
no O
other O
symptoms O
. O
Has O
any O
one O
else O
come O
across O
this O
symptom O
? O
I O
m O
tempted O
to O
go O
off O
the O
medicine O
to O
see O
if O
the O
paralysis B-ADR
goes O
away O
. O
It O
really O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
a O
lot O
, O
so O
I O
hope O
this O
problem O
isn;t O
related O
. O

Some O

( O
Cont'd O
- O
Pt.2 O
) O
According O
to O
my O
' O
GP O
' O
( O
Dr O
) O
, O
the O
UK O
male O
' O
desireable O
target O
' O
is O
5.1 O
amol O
/litre O
or O
196 O
mg O
/decilitre O
. O
Docs O
now O
actually O
like O
you O
to O
be O
lower O
than O
that O
if O
possible O
. O
In O
1977 O
( O
at O
age O
28 O
) O
with O
a O
' O
count O
' O
of O
10mmol O
/L O
( O
385mg O
/dl O
) O
, O
a O
VERY O
careful O
low O
-chol O
. O
diet O
made O
virtually O
NO O
difference O
to O
my O
count O
. O
So O
I O
went O
onto O
Zocor O
( O
new O
-ish O
then O
) O
and O
remained O
on O
it O
for O
21 O
years O
, O
finally O
on O
a O
dose O
of O
40mg O
/day O
with O
no O
real O
side O
effects O
- O
it O
lowered O
my O
count O
to O
5.6mmol O
/L. O
As O
my O
count O
started O
to O
rise O
again O
to O
7.8 O
in O
1997 O
( O
at O
age O
48 O
) O
, O
I O
switched O
to O
Lipitor O
, O
starting O
with O
20mg O
/day O
and O
then O
40mg O
/day O
which O
dropped O
my O
count O
A O
LOT O
to O
just O
5.1mmol O
/L O
and O
with O
an O
HDL O
' O
good O
cholesterol O
' O
count O
of O
1.6 O
. O
After O
a O
3-week O
holiday O
without O
pills O
, O
my O
count O
rose O
to O
10.4 O
, O
so O
I O
went O
back O
onto O
40mg O
/day O
of O
Lipitor O
- O
but O
my O
count O
was O
still O
only O
6.7 O
, O
so O
I O
put O
myself O
onto O
80mg O
/day O
Lipitor O
and O
my O
count O
went O
down O
to O
5.5 O
- O
this O
is O
the O
highest O
dose O
recommended O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
on O
this O

Muscle B-ADR
and I-ADR
joint I-ADR
aches I-ADR
in I-ADR
arms I-ADR
, I-ADR
elbows I-ADR
, I-ADR
and I-ADR
calves I-ADR
. O
Felt O
worse O
when O
woke O
up O
. O
I O
' O
m O
53 O
and O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
83 O
. O
Lots B-ADR
of I-ADR
gas I-ADR
. O
Been O
taking O
for O
7 O
years O
. O
Symptoms O
appeared O
first O
last O
yr O
- O
early O
06 O
- O
stopped O
taking O
for O
two O
months O
, O
restarted O
and O

07 O
. O
Dosage O
for O
past O
2 O
yrs O
has O
been O
40 O

once O
a O
day O
. O

After O
three O
months O
on O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
started O
to O
feel B-ADR
like I-ADR
an I-ADR
airhead I-ADR
-- O
slightly B-ADR
dizzy I-ADR
virtually I-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR
and O
frequently B-ADR
unable I-ADR
to I-ADR
think I-ADR
clearly I-ADR
. O
I O
actually O
started O
to O
wonder O
if O
I O
were O
developing O
early O
Alzheimer B-DIS
's I-DIS
( O
I O
' O
m O
58 O
) O
. O
After O
five O
months O
, O
I O
developed O
severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
thighs I-ADR
and I-ADR
knees I-ADR
and O
I O
' O
m O
exhausted B-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR
. O
So O
far O
my O
blood O
tests O
have O
been O
normal O
, O
but O
now O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
read O
these O
posts O
, O
I O
' O
m O
going O
to O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
It O
did O
lower O
my O
total O
cholesterol O
from O
235 O
to O
200 O
. O

I O
took O
Lipitor O
for O
8 O
weeks O
and O
experienced O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
all I-ADR
my I-ADR
joints I-ADR
. O
It O
has O
brought O
me O
to O
tears O
and O
I O
have O
had O
to O
use O
sick O
leave O
from O
work O
. O
My O
doctor O
tested O
me O
for O
arthritis B-DIS
and O
other O
problems O
and O
all O
tests O
came O
back O
normal O
but O
thank O
goodness O
she O
took O
me O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
medication O
. O

Severe O
and O
prolonged O
leg O
, O
ankle O
, O
toe O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
every O
night O
. O
Doctor O
said O
it O
was O
not O
the O
lipitor O
. O
went O
off O
it O
myself O
. O
Now O
off O
6 O
myths O
. O
NO O
more O
muscle B-ADR
pain!. O

Mild O
sedation B-ADR
. O
This O
is O
a O
GREAT O
drug O
for O
me O
. O
I O
am O
usually O
VERY O
affected O
negatively O
with O
most O
meds O
. O
Voltaren O
totally O
relieves O
my O
pain B-DIS
when O
nothing O
else O
worked O
. O
I O
take O
it O
with O
a O
meal O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
stomach B-DIS
problems I-DIS
with O
it O
. O
It O
mellows B-DIS
me I-DIS
out I-DIS
a O
little O
but O
not O
too O
much O
. O

For O
the O
first O
8 O
days O
of O
ever O
taking O
it O
, O
the O
only O
side O
effect O
was O
a O
similar O
feeling O
you O
get O
when O
you O
have O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
light B-ADR
nausea I-ADR
that O
lasted O
for O
no O
more O
that O
30 O
minutes O
After O
8 O
days O
, O
the O
feeling O
elevated O
to O
an O
annoying O
sharp B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
. O
Then O
two O
days O
later O
, O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
using O
it O
because O
the O
pain B-ADR
was I-ADR
becoming I-ADR
unbearable I-ADR
. O
Now O
I O
have O
been O
off O
for O
two O
days O
and O
I O
still O
have O
the O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
Aside O
from O
the O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
it O
worked O
miracle O
on O
my O
nighttime O
spinal B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
Now O
I O
have O
to O
see O
my O
doctor O
again O
to O
see O
if O
I O
should O
keep O
taking O
it O
. O
I O
tried O
Naprosyn O
just O
before O
and O
had O
to O
stop O
taking O
it O
for O
the O
same O
reasons O
. O

After O
about O
10 O
weeks O
on O
Lipitor O
I O
suddenly O
developed O
pain B-ADR
/cramps I-ADR
in I-ADR
both I-ADR
my I-ADR
legs I-ADR
, O
the O
left O
being O
slightly O
worse O
than O
the O
right O
. O
The O
cramps B-ADR
and O
tightness B-ADR
was O
sporadic O
from O
ankles O
, O
to O
calf O
to O
top O
of O
thigh O
then O
back O
of O
thigh O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
make O
sense O
as O
I O
had O
n't O
done O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
to O
be O
feeling O
this O
way O
and O
it O
felt O
different O
than O
a O
overworked O
muscle O
type O
of O
pain B-DIS
. O
Although O
the O
Lipitor O
brought O
my O
level O
from O
206 O
down O
to O
143 O
within O
6 O
weeks O
from O
what O
I O
have O
been O
reading O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
will O
begin O

it O
again O

I O
stopped O
about O
a O
week O

, O
although O
my O
Dr O
did O
n't O
think O
that O
was O
the O
cause O
, O
however O
, O
nothing O

made O
sense O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
/tightness O
is O
somewhat O
better O
than O
it O
was O
3 O

) O
He O
checked O
the O
CK O
reading O
, O
which O
came O
back O
negative O
. O
I O
used O
to O
work O
out O
at O
a O
gym O
for O
one O
hour O
twice O
a O
week O
, O
and O
he O
suggested O
that O
I O
was O
getting O
older O
and O
the O
workouts O
might O
be O
too O
extreme O
. O
I O
went O
back O
to O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
began O
cutting O
back O
on O
my O
exercise O
. O
After O
6 O
months O
, O
in O
agony O
, O
I O
went O
for O
more O
blood O

--everything O
was O
negative O
. O
After O
9 O
months O
I I-ADR
stopped O
the B-ADR
Lipitor I-ADR
myself I-ADR
, I-ADR
but O
by O
then O
I B-ADR
was I-ADR
a I-ADR
mess I-ADR
: I-ADR
could I-ADR
n't O
walk O
, O
could O
n't I-ADR
lift I-ADR
my I-ADR

My O
family O
doctor O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
. O
I O
went O
to O
a O
NY O
neurologist O
, O
then O
to O
a O
neuromuscular O
doctor O
who O
said O
it O
sounded O
like O
Lipitor O
, O
even O
though O
I O
had O
been O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
. O
He O
suggested O
coenzymeq10 O
, O
600 O
mg O
per O
day O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
20 O
mg O
of O
lipitor O
for O
1 O
year O
, O
It O
has O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
to O
225 O
but O
I O
can O
not O
deal O
with O
the O
agony O
of O
constant O
gas B-ADR
and O
loose B-ADR
stools I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
also O
experiencing O
heel B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
The O
loose B-ADR
stools I-ADR
and O
gas B-ADR
are O
more O
than O
I O
can O
bear O
. O
anyone O
switch O
to O
a O
different O
statin O
drug O
that O
did O
not O
cause O
loose B-ADR
stools I-ADR
and O
constant O
gas B-ADR
? O

I O
was O
a O
vibrant O

On O
Easter O
Sunday O
my O
ankles B-ADR

seized I-ADR
up I-ADR

I O

I O
am O
assured O
that O
I O
will O
make O
a O
full O

within O
six O

I O
shuffle B-ADR
when I-ADR
I I-ADR

I O

only O
just O
coping O
. O
I O
am O
not O
quite O
a O

not O

I O
started O
using O
the O
drug O
in O
Sept. O
2005 O
. O
In O
October O
/November O
I O
noticed O
my O
hands B-ADR
were I-ADR
nowhere I-ADR
near I-ADR
as I-ADR
strong I-ADR
as I-ADR
they I-ADR
once I-ADR
were I-ADR
- O
thought O
it O
was O
old O
age O
. O
I O
also O
had O
a O
strange O
sensitivity B-ADR
in I-ADR
the I-ADR
palms I-ADR
and I-ADR
soles I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
feet I-ADR
, I-ADR
also I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
scalp I-ADR
- O
it O
was O
uncomfortable O
blowing O
my O
hair O
dry O
. O
It O
was O
not O
a O
tingling B-ADR
, O
just O
a O
sensitivity B-ADR
. O
In O
November O
, O
I O
was O
running O
, O
and O
my O
feet B-ADR
felt I-ADR
like I-ADR
led I-ADR
- O
thought O
it O
was O
old O
age O
. O
In O
December O
, O
my O
ankles B-ADR
started I-ADR
aching I-ADR
- O
gee O
, O
am O
I O
getting O
old O
! O
In O
January O
, O
I O
started O
to O
go O
to O
the O
gym O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that O
this O
is O
where O
my O
problems O
really O
started O
. O
My O
already O
over B-ADR
-stressed I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, O
over O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
, O
went O
into O

. O
This O
drug O
is O
a O
terrible O
, O
terrible O
drug O
and O
should O
not O
be O
prescribed O

The O

about O

the O

a O

Side O
effects O
are O
some O
drowsiness B-ADR

some O

Can O
take O
it O
on O
an O
empty O

with O
no O

. O
The O
drowsiness B-ADR
is O
nice O
and O
helps O
me O

I O
still O
have O
to O
take O
it O
in O

with O
a O
stronger O

, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
a O
good O
drug O
for O

My O
LDL O

MD O
insisted O
that O
because O
I O
am O
diabetic B-DIS
, O
I O
should O
be O
on O
lipitor O
and O
try O
to O
get O
below O
70 O

Lipitor O
knocked O
it O
down O
to O
25 O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
problems O
were O
due O
to O
Lipitor O
, O
or O
having O
LDL O
down O
to O
25 O
. O
I O
asked O
MD O
he O
stated O
They O
( O
whomever O
they O
are O
) O
, O
have O
not O
established O
a O
low O
threshold O
for O
what O
is O
safe O
. O
I O
stated O
that O
just O
because O
it O
has O
not O
been O
proven O
in O
a O
lab O
, O
does O
not O
mean O
it O
is O
not O
true O
. O
I O
went O
off O
the O
meds O
, O
and O
am O
now O
in O
search O
of O
a O
new O
MD O
, O
as O
I O
have O
felt O
worse O

After O
ten O
years O
of O

I O
stopped O
taking O
lipitor O
/atorvastatin O
, O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
my O
doctor O
, O
for O
a O
week O
to O
relieve O
severe O
shoulder B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
which O
I O
extended O
to O
ten O
days O
when O
I O
noticed O
an O
amazing O
improvement O
in O
my O
general O
well O
-being O
and O
after O
the O
ten O
days O
felt O
so O
much O
better O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
altogether O
. O
For O
those O
who O
feel O
a O
long O
life O
is O
preferable O
to O
a O
good O
life O
, O
this O
drug O
may O
be O
worth O
taking O
; O
for O
those O
who O
have O
enjoyed O
life O
and O
would O
prefer O
a O
slightly O
shorter O
one O
to O
a O
longer O
miserable O
one O
, O
stopping O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O
Trust O
me O
- O
I O
get O
up O
every O
morning O
feeling O
a O
thousand O
times O
better O
, O
stay O
busy O
and O
active O
all O
day O
long O
and O
feel O
as O
I O
used O
to O
feel O
before O
I O
started O
taking O
this O
drug O

and O
ALL O
of O
the O
symptoms O
have O
completely O
disappeared O

Joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR

muscle B-ADR

While O
doctors O
will O
test O
your O
liver O
function O
on O
this O
medication O
, O
and O
they O
may O
run O
a O
blood O
test O
to O
check O
for O

many O
doctors O
deny O
that O
there O
is O
a O
connection O
between O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR
aching I-ADR
, O

etc O
and O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
medication O
and O
the O
symptoms O
gradually O
dissipated O
. O
About O
a O
year O
later O
, O
I O
was O
put O
on O
it O
again O
and O
once O
again O
the O
same O
symptoms O
returned O
. O
I O
saw O
another O
doctor O
and O
this O
physician O
is O
the O
one O
that O
stated O
that O
Lipitor O
is O
more O
than O
likely O
the O
cause O
. O
Another O
family O
member O
was O
on O
Lipitor O
and O
experienced O
very O
similar O
symptoms O
. O
She O
took O
herself O
off O
of O
the O
medication O
her O
symptoms O
also O
began O
to O
fade O
. O
She O
demanded O
to O
be O
put O
on O
another O
medication O
and O
was O
. O
Not O
all O
people O
who O
take O
Lipitor O
will O
have O
adverse O
reactions O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
experience O
these O
symptoms O
, O
do O
n't O
just O
accept O
your O
doctor O
's O
denial O
of O
a O
connection O
between O
the O
two O
. O
You O
may O
want O
to O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O

Worked O

at O

It O
is O

I O
was O
taking O
Red O

for O
cholesterol O

but O
then O
big O

got O
in O
the O

and O
made O
that O
illegal O
. O
Do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
is O
still O
the O
case O
. O
My O
doctor O
said O
Lipitor O
was O
the O
most O
tested O
statin O
drug O
. O
My O
real O
concern O
is O
heart B-DIS
disease I-DIS
which O
is O
in O
my O
family O
. O
Not O
sure O
of O
how O
tight O
the O
correlation O
is O
between O
low O
cholesterol O
numbers O
and O
low O
risk O
of O
coronary B-DIS
problems I-DIS
. O
AMA O
dumbs O
down O
the O
information O
to O
make O
is O
sound O
like O
getting O
down O
to O
ridiculous O
levels O
( O
100 O
) O
insures O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
problems O
. O
I O
doubt O
it O
. O
Probably O
much O
more O
based O
on O
genetic O
history O
. O
So O
Lipitor O
is O
great O
for O
reducing O
your O
numbers O
, O
but O
extending O
