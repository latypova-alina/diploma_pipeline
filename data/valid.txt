a O
few O

my O

swelling I-ADR
up O
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O

the O

of O
my O

there O
was O
something O

I O
am O
a O

. O
My O
blood B-ADR

had I-ADR
gone I-ADR
sky I-ADR

so O
my O
that O
is O
why O
the O

. O
I O
was O
told O
to O
stop O
taking O
Arthritic O
and O
am O
now O
using O
a O
natural O

that O
seems O
to O
work O
it O
is O
called O
Pernasal O
. O

Initially O
minor O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
but O
thought O
it O
was O
due O
to O
my O
working O
out O

After O
two O

of O
use O
- O
SEVERE B-ADR

Pain B-ADR
immediately O
declined O
within O

I O

EXTREMELY O
DANGEROUS O
DRUG O
! O
I O
have O
never O
had O
these O
problems O
until O
I O
started O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
have O
discontinued O
it O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
with O
now O
a O
40 O
% O
reduction O
in O
side O
effects O
but O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
still O
really O
bad O
. O
Does O
anyone O
know O
how O
long O
it O
will O
take O
for O
the O
side O
effects O
to O
completely O
go O
away O
? O
Will O
they O
go O
away O
? O
Lipitor O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
from O
268 O
to O
163 O
but O
it O
nearly O
killed O
me O
in O
return O
. O
It O
's O
not O
worth O
it O
. O
The O
doctor O
told O
me O
I O
was O
imagining O
all O
this O
and O
said O
it O
was O
so O
safe O
it O
should O
be O
in O
the O
drinking O
water O
supply O
. O
Can O
you O
believe O
that O
! O
This O
drug O
is O
an O
extremely O
dangerous O
poison O
. O
The O
Pfizer O
website O
is O
very O
low O
-key O
about O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
You O
better O
take O
matters O
into O
your O
own O
hands O
as O
Pfizer O
's O
only O
concern O
is O
profits O
- O
NOT O
your O
health O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taken O
for O
approximately O
4 O
yrs O
. O
I O
have O
some O
difficulty B-ADR
with I-ADR
digestive I-ADR
system I-ADR
and O
some O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
Lipitor O
did O
the O
job O
on O
my O
cholesterol O
both O
LDL O
and O
HDL O
. O
I O
have O
quit O
taken O
recently O
to O
see O
if O
it O
affects O
above O
problems O
. O
It O
probably O
is O
a O
trade O
off O
. O
I O
feel O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
too O
expensive O
. O
I O
do O
think O
that O
it O
will O
do O
what O
it O
is O
used O
for O
, O
but O
I O
think O
your O
body O
pays O
a O
price O
. O
Again O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
trade O
off O
. O

incredible O
depression B-ADR
almost O
immediately O
after O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
. O
crying B-ADR
all I-ADR
the I-ADR
time I-ADR
, O
not B-ADR
sleeping I-ADR
, O
reliving B-ADR
of I-ADR
past I-ADR
terrible I-ADR
events I-ADR
that O
had O
occurred O
in O
my O
life O
, O
like O
someone O
pushing O
a O
doorbell O
and O
holding O
it O
to O
keep O
ringing O
and O
reliving O
all O
the O
terrible O
negative O
things O
in O
my O
life O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O
I O
kept O
asking O
my O
doctor O
if O
there O
were O
any O
side O
effects O
like O
mine O
and O
he O
said O
no O
. O
I O
had O
been O
taking O
zocor O
with O
no O
problem O
but O
insurance O
company O
would O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
anymore O
and O
made O
me O
go O
on O
lipitor O
. O
After O
about O
six O
months O
I O
had O
my O
doctor O
write O
a O
letter O
to O
ins O
. O
co. O
saying O
I O
could O
n't O
take O
lipitor O
and O
they O
agreed O
to O
put O
me O
back O
on O
zocor O
. O
But O
the O
long O
term O
effect O
of O
those O
six O
months O
sent O
me O
into O
a O
psychological B-ADR
tailspin I-ADR
that O
I O
never O
recovered O
from O
. O
I O
went O
to O
three O
psychiatrist O
and O
they O
finally O
came O
up O
with O
a O
diagnoses O
of O
bipolar B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
. O
Cause O
unknown O
. O
This O
was O
three O
years O
ago O
. O
The O
drug O
ruined O
my O
life O
, O
I O
am O
now O
seperate O
after O
this O
all O
occurred O
and O
before O
the O
lipitor O
I O
was O
an O
energetic O
happy O
family O
man O
with O
a O
great O
wife O
and O
two O
kids O
. O
I O
know O
it O
was O
the O
lipitor O
because O
the O
only O
other O
medication O
I O
take O
is O
an O
aspirin O
once O
a O
day O
. O

Very O
little O
side O

Now O
I O

and O

most O
activities O

Been O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
two O
years O
. O
The O
last O
few O
days O
I O
have O
experienced O
swollen B-ADR
legs I-ADR
and I-ADR
ankles I-ADR
and O
a O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
lower I-ADR
leg I-ADR
making O
it O
hard O
to O
get O
around O
. O
Thought O
it O
might O
be O
the O
Lipitor O
so O
I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
doctor O
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O
I O
think O
I O
will O
discontinue O
using O
Lipitor O
and O
try O
to O
find O
another O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
. O

I O
' O
ve O
been O
taking O
LIPITOR O
for O
a O
few O
years O
( O
had O
been O
on O
Baycol O
) O
, O
. O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
began O
experiencing O
increasing O
joint B-ADR
and I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
is O
now O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
am O
wondering O
if O
it O
's O
worth O
living O
with O
such O
pain B-ADR
. O
I O
' O
m O
very O
depressed B-ADR
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
is O
often O
so O
severe O
that O
it O
limits B-ADR
my I-ADR
ability I-ADR
to I-ADR
walk I-ADR
and I-ADR
climb I-ADR
stairs I-ADR
, I-ADR
to I-ADR
lift I-ADR
anything I-ADR

I O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
excruciating O
thigh B-ADR

, O
and O
more O
recently O
, O
I O
have O
noticed O
a O
generalized O
weakness B-ADR
all O
over O
my O
body O
. O
It O
scares O
me O
to O
stop O
taking O
some O
statin O
drug O
because O
my O
cholesterol B-DIS
was I-DIS
very I-DIS
high I-DIS
without O
them O
, O
but O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
is O
so O
drastically O
affected O
that O
I O
think O
I O
have O
to O
. O
I O
believe O
it O
's O
very O
dangerous O
stuff O
. O

terrible O
neck B-ADR

, O

is O
just O

none O
I O
can O
attribute O
directly O
to O
the O
medication O
. O
One O
must O
follow O
liver O
function O
tests O
( O
e.g. O

all O
these O

they O
are O
the O

my O
partner O
is O
currently O
taking O
this O
medication O
lipitor O
, O
he O
also O
takes O
high O
blood O
pressure O
medication O
, O
my O
reason O
for O
initially O
looking O
for O
side O
effects O
of O
lipitor O
was O
because O
of O
my O
partners O
decreased B-ADR
libido I-ADR
and O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
a O
connection O
between O
this O
and O
the O
medication O
, O
however O
i O
noticed O
a O
small O
number O
of O
people O
are O
suffering O
in O
this O
way O
, O
i O
can O
not O
believe O
the O
amount O
of O
things O
that O
are O
causing O
such O
a O
big O
problem O
for O
so O
many O
people O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
my O
partner O
is O
normally O
very O
muscular O
as O
works O
out O
twice O
a O
week O
and O
has O
done O
for O
years O
, O
but O
over O
the O
last O
6mths O
or O
so O
seems O
to O
have O
lost B-ADR
a I-ADR
lot I-ADR
of I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
and I-ADR
replaced I-ADR
with I-ADR
fat I-ADR
, O
especially O
around O
the O
midriff O
, O
he O
also O
suffers O
from O
regular O
diorama B-ADR
and O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
back I-ADR
and I-ADR
just I-ADR
below I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
blades I-ADR
, O
very O
often O
also O
suffers O
from O
headaches B-ADR
, O
does B-ADR
nt I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
very I-ADR
well I-ADR
at I-ADR
night I-ADR
at O
all O
, O
also O
gets B-ADR
tired I-ADR
a I-ADR
lot I-ADR
, O
my O
partner O
is O
nt O
aware O
of O
this O
website O
but O
i O
will O
be O
definedly O
showing O
this O
to O
him O
and O
advising O
him O
to O
perhaps O
stop O
taking O
this O
medication O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
to O
see O
what O
the O
difference O
is O
, O
so O
glad O
to O
have O
found O

I O
did O

until O
my O

I O

Diabetes B-DIS
( O
which O
would O
cause O
this O
) O
and O
was O
tested O
in O
DC O
at O
WRAAC O
and O
they O
found O
no O
reason O
that O
I O
should O
have O
this O
and O
gave O
me O
a O

of O
Caesarian O
! O
! O
! O
I O
still O
live O
with O
this O
. O
Four O
years O
ago O
I O
developed O
Frozen B-ADR
Shoulder I-ADR
in O
my O
left O
arm O
, O
unbelievable O
pain B-ADR
, O
within O
weeks O
the O
other O
shoulder B-ADR
became I-ADR
as I-ADR
painful I-ADR
as O
the O
first O
, O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
raise I-ADR
my I-ADR

at O
all O
, O
tested O
at O
Bethesda O

. O
, O
no O
reason O
found O
, O
I O
was O
told O
it O
would O
last O
about O
2 O
years O
unless O
I O
took O
therapy O
sessions O
, O
I O
took O
the O
sessions O
and O
begged O
for O
someone O
to O
put O
me O
out O
of O
my O
misery O
each O
time O
, O
it O
eventually O
passed O
in O
about O
a O
year O
but O
I O
still O
have O
shoulder B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
Today O
I O
am O
stopping O
the O
Lipitor O
, O
maybe O
I O
have O
read O
too O
much O
on O
the O
subject O
but O
the O
one O
that O
really O
scares O
me O
is O
the O
Memory B-ADR

, O
All O
the O
drug O
com O
. O
tests O
were O
done O
to O
see O
how O
well O
the O
Statins O
did O
for O

the O

benefits O

but O
no O

( O
or O
none O
that O
the O

) O
was O
ever O
done O
to O

how O
it O

the O

Memory O
is O
too O
precious O
a O
thing O
to O
lose O

a O

If O

I O

So O

Took O
for O
30 O
days O
. O
Was O
aware O
of O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
DOC O
assured O
me O
they O
were O
minimal O
. O
I O
started O
getting O
some O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
ankles I-ADR
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
I O
work O
out O
so O
attributed O
the O
pain B-ADR
to O
$ O
old O
age O
$ O
( O
45 O
) O
. O
I O
was O
in O
Baltimore O

I O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
sleep I-ADR
. O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
better O
the O
next O
day O
, O
but O
limped B-ADR
around O
a O
bit O
. O
A O
week O
later O
the O
pain B-ADR
came O
back O
, O
my O
ankle B-ADR
hurt I-ADR
so O
much O
I O
could O
hardly O
make O
to O
work O
. O
I O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
walk I-ADR
up I-ADR
the I-ADR

in O
my O

without O
extreme B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
I O
felt O
horrible O
& O
made O
an O
appointment O

Thought O
it O
might O
be O
gout O
, O
but O
found O
this O

crap O
before O

. O

me O
off O

I O
wish O

this O

successfully O
the O

, O
but O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
have O
adverse O
effects O
this O
can O
be O
deviating O
. O
It O
took O
me O
3 O

weeks O
to O
fully O
recover O
. O
MD O
's O
need O

their O

I O
would O
rater O

than O

I O
have O
to O
wonder O
if O

Chronic B-ADR

in I-ADR
all I-ADR
my I-ADR
joints I-ADR

. O
Really O
bad O
in O
my O

. O
I O
had O
been O
on O
Pravachol O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
and O
switched O
to O
Lipitor O
because O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
lower O
triglycerides O
too O
. O
I O
had O
the O
joint B-ADR
and I-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pain I-ADR
already O
and O
was O
told O
it O
was O
arthritis B-DIS
or O

( O
I O
' O
m O
also O
a O
diabetic B-DIS
) O
. O
My O

were I-ADR
never I-ADR
this I-ADR
sore I-ADR
before O

at O
a O
relatively O
young O
age O
( O
dad-57 O

, O
but O
if O
this O
is O
what O
is O
causing O
this O

I O
think O
I O
would O
rather O
die O
prematurely O
than O
live O
like O
this O

I O

However O
, O
after O

the O

on O
this O

, O
I O
will O
stop O

actually O
making O
my O

Because O
I O

, O
I O
stopped O

. O
Cholesterol O
went O
up O
almost O
immediately O
after O

I O
felt O
great O
again O
and O
was O
able O

run O
again O
. O
A O
year O
later O
I O
tried O
Lipitor O
again O
with O
the O
same O
side O
effects O
as O
before O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
and O
decided O
to O
live O
with O
high O
cholesterol O
as O
taking O
this O
drug O
made O
my O
life O
not O
worth O
living O
. O

after O
taking O
the O

for O
several O

I O
developed O
one O
of O
the O
supposedly O

fortunately O
when O
I O
experienced O
fatigue B-ADR
and O
muscle B-ADR
/joint I-ADR

, O
I O
remembered O
some O
of O
the O
warnings O
I O
had O
read O
when O
I O
first O
started O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O
My O
doctor O
ordered O
a O
blood O
test O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
my O
symptoms O
and O
concerns O
and O
it O
revealed O
a O
grossly B-DIS
excessive I-DIS
amount I-DIS
of I-DIS
muscle I-DIS
tissue I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
blood I-DIS
. O
I O
have O
n't O
taken O
it O
since O
. O
after O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
felt O
normal O
about O
three O
weeks O
later O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
simvastatin O
for O
about O
5 O
years,,since O
March O
2010 O
i O
have O
been O
experiencing O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
leg I-ADR
and I-ADR
foot I-ADR
with O
extrem B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
ankle I-ADR
and O
at O
times O
i O
have O
had O
difficultly B-ADR
in I-ADR
walking I-ADR
to O
the O
point O
were O
on O
some O
days O
i O
could B-ADR
not I-ADR
walk I-ADR
at O
all O
because O
the O
pain B-ADR
was O
so O
bad O
also O
had O
pain O
in O
my O
left O
arm O
as O
if O
i O
had O
strained O
it O
lifting O
but O
i O
have't O
been O
lifting O
, O
this O
is O
not O
like O
me O
because O
i O
am O
normal O
very O
fit O
and O
i O
love O
walking O
. O
doctor O
refered O
me O
to O
hospital O
for O
xray O
on O
my O
foot O
which O
proved O
normal O
, O
after O
reading O
some O
of O
the O
threads O
on O
here O
i O
decided O
not O
to O
take O
my O
nightly O
statin O
( O
20m.gr O
. O
) O
Since O
i O
decided O
to O
give O
them O
a O
miss O
i O
find O
that O
the O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
foot I-ADR
is O
subsiding O
and O
i O
can O
walk O
a O
lot O
better O
. O
i O
never O
had O
this O
problem O
with O
my O
foot O
and O
arm O
untill O
i O
took O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
mentioned O
this O
to O
my O
doctor O
who O
said O
in O
not O
many O
words O
that O
i O
should O
have O
no O
side O
effects O
from O
simvastatin O
. O
well O
i O
have O
proved O
him O
wrong O
. O
I O
can O
only O
hope O
that O
having O
taken O
this O
drug O
for O
5 O
years O
that O
not O
to O
much O
d. O

all O

the O

I O
guess O
go O
back O

It O

not O

that O
there O

any O
. O
I O
' O

concerned O

imagining O
them O

the O
long O
list O

side O
effects O
. O
Medicine O
is O
scary O
, O
but O
it O
's O
sure O
working O
. O

This O
drug O
was O
prescribed O
to O
help O
with O
severe B-DIS
knee I-DIS
pain I-DIS
while O
I O
wait O
for O
additional O
diagnostics O
and O
possibly O
surgery O
after O
1/1 O
( O
due O
to O
high O
deductible O
on O
health O
insurance O
) O
. O
Pain O
was O
bad O
enough O
that O
I B-DIS
had I-DIS
trouble I-DIS
standing I-DIS
up I-DIS
from I-DIS
sitting I-DIS
position I-DIS
. O
After O
about O
24 O
hours O
, O
the O
pain O
was O
essentially O
gone O
and O
has O
stayed O
gone O
so O
far O
. O

The O
same O
as O
many O
people O
reported O
muscle B-ADR
aches I-ADR
as O
well O
as O
tingling B-ADR
in I-ADR
arm I-ADR
and I-ADR
hand I-ADR
, O
sore B-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
poor B-ADR
sleep I-ADR
although O
it O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
I O
was O
not O
warned O
of O
the O
symptoms O
. O
Surprisingly O
when O
I O
told O
my O
doctor O
I O
was O
having O
these O
problems O
he O
did O
not O
suggest O
stopping O
the O
lipitor O
nor O
did O
any O
of O
the O
other O
specialists O
I O
went O
to O
see O
for O
these O
symptoms O
, O
a O
friend O
told O
me O
about O
the O
side O
affects O
after O
I O
told O
her O
my O
symptoms O
, O
she O
said O
they O
were O
the O
same O
as O
statins O
and O
what O
was O
I O
taking O
? O
Lipitor O
! O
I O
have O
since O
changed O
doctors O
because O
my O
doctor O
told O
me O
he O
did O
not O
believe O
it O
was O
the O
lipitor O
since O
it O
should O
have O
affected O
me O
on O
both O
arms O
and O
hands O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
stopped O
the O
lipitor O
I O
stated O
to O
feel O
better O
, O
it O
has O
been O
three O
weeks O
now O
I O
still O
have O
some O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, O
but O
severe B-ADR
fatigue I-ADR
is O
gone O
, O
Problem O
now O
is O
my O
new O
doctor O
is O
suggesting O
Pravachol O
! O
I O
would O
rather O
live O
a O
shorter O
life O
than O
suffer O
the O
pains B-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
for O
many O
years O
. O

HORRIBLE B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
horrible B-ADR
back I-ADR

, O
spasms B-ADR
in I-ADR
leg I-ADR
muscles I-ADR
, O
nausea B-ADR

so O
bad O
that O
I O
could B-ADR
hardly I-ADR
walk I-ADR
or I-ADR
sit I-ADR
. O
chest B-ADR
pains I-ADR
, O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
2x O
not O
knowing O
what O
it O
was O
from O
. O
One O
Doctor O
finally O
took O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
told O
me O
it O
was O
from O
the O
lipitor O
. O

NEVER O
NEVER O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG O
. O
I O
am O
hoping O
that O
I O
did O
not O
hurt O
myself O
permanently O
by O
taking O
it O
. O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
to O
find O
out O

I O
almost O

I O

? O
) O
. O
fatigue B-ADR
. O
As O
the O
dose O
increases O
the O
pain B-ADR
has O
worsened O
. O
I O
have O
been O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
probably O
10 O
yrs O
. O
Have O
tried O
nearly O
all O
statins O
with O
similar O
side O
effects O
. O
10 O
mg O
no O
real O
side O
effects O
, O
no O
real O

either O
; O
40 O
mps- O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR

but O
able O
to O
tolerate O
it O
though O
not O
happy O
and O
still O
no O
appreciable O
change O
in O
cholesterol O
. O
now O
on O
80 O
mg O
and O
feeling O
extremely O
uncomfortable O
. O
Why O
am O
I O
on O
80 O
mg O
? O
because O
the O
insurance O
company O
required O
a O
trial O
at O
this O
high O
level O
, O
before O
I O
can O
switch O
to O
an O
alternative O
and O
reduce O
the O
dose O
back O
to O
40 O
mg O
. O
Since O
when O
did O
the O
insurance O
company O
go O
to O
med O
school O
so O
they O
can O
dictate O
what O
I O
should O
be O
on O
. O
sorry O
for O
the O
rant O
. O

Pain B-ADR
along I-ADR
front I-ADR
and I-ADR
outer I-ADR
side I-ADR
of I-ADR
shins I-ADR
. O
very O
tender B-ADR
to I-ADR
the I-ADR
touch I-ADR
. O
walking O
was O
the O
worst O
, O
some O
weird B-ADR
toe I-ADR
tingling I-ADR
at O
times O
. O
lasted O
for O
years O
, O
told O
it O
was O
a O
pinched B-DIS
nerve I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
back I-DIS
. O
After O
reading O
reports O
on O
the O
internet O
I O
stopped O
it O
a O
month O
ago O
and O
its O
about O
50 O
% O
better O
already O
. O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
side O
effects O
seem O
much O
more O
common O
than O
realized O
by O
doctors O
or O
admitted O
by O
the O
company O
. O

I O
started O
to O
take O
20 O
mg O
lipitor O
in O
August O
2006 O
, O
after O
6 O
months O
, O
I O
reduced O
to O
take O
10 O
mg O
, O
and O
after O
another O
6 O
months O
, O
I O
reduced O
the O
lipitor O
intake O
to O
5 O
mg O
. O
During O
all O
these O
18 O
months O
, O
my O
LDL O
and O
cholesterol O
in O
70s O
and O
120s O
and O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
much O
side O
effects O
. O
When O
I O
increased O
lipitor O
from O
5 O
mg O
to O
10 O
mg O
about O
3 O
months O
ago O
, O
I O
started O
to O
experience O
the O
following O
side O
-effects O
started O
at O
different O
time O
: O
loss B-ADR
body I-ADR
balance I-ADR
, O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR
aches I-ADR
, O
weak B-ADR
legs I-ADR
, O
and O
some O
memory B-ADR
loss I-ADR
. O
About O
2 O
months O
ago O
while O
I O
first O
told O
my O
doctor O
I O
lost B-ADR
some I-ADR
body I-ADR
balance I-ADR
and O
it O
might O
be O
due O
to O
lipitor O
buy O
my O
doctor O
told O
me O
the O
side O
effect O
was O
most O
likely O
by O
some O
other O
reason(s O
) O
. O
During O
my O
second O
visiting O
him O
, O
he O
told O
me O
my O
blood O
test O
CK O
is O
90 O
and O
my O
muscle O
should O
be O
OK O
. O
Then O
I O
continued O
to O
take O
10 O
mg O
lipitor O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
more O
on O
muscle B-ADR
and I-ADR
joint I-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
I O
started O
to O
feel O
I O
lost B-ADR
some I-ADR
memory I-ADR
. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
deeply O
believed O
that O
I O
had O
side O
effects O
by O
taking O
lipitor O
. O
After O
about O
a O
week O
to O
10 O
day O
without O
lipitor O
, O
I O
got O
my O
memory O
back O
to O
normal O
level O
and O
my O
body O
balance O
is O
getting O
better O
. O
During O
my O
third O
doctor O
visit O
, O
my O
doctor O
finally O
believed O
that O
I O
got O
bad O
side O
effects O
and O
he O
told O
me O
it O
would O
take O
months O
for O
recovery O
. O
Now O
my O
doctor O
wants O
me O
to O
take O
B3 O
or O
Niassan O
instead O
of O
lipitor O
. O

I O
have O
taken O
6 O
pills O
in O
the O
past O
( O
75 O
mg O
each O
) O
, O
but O
the O
side O
effect O
I O
had O
from O
my O
last O
pill O
was O
awful O
. O
It O
induced O
severe B-ADR
vaginal I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
without O
bleeding O
about O
2 O
hours O
after O
I O
took O
the O
medication O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
take O
additional O
medication O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
cramps B-ADR
( O
pamplin O
) O
so O
that O
I O
could O
sleep O
. O
Sat O
on O
the O
bathroom O
for O
30 O
minutes O
. O
If O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
have O
went O
to O
bed O
with O
a O
sore B-DIS
knee I-DIS
instead O
- O
it O
hurt O
less O
than O
the O
cramps B-ADR
. O
This O
is O
the O
only O
anti O

drug O
that O
helps O
for O
my O
knee B-DIS

and O
its O
reliable O
in O

. O
I O
take O
it O
infrequently O

once O
every O

is O
often O
enough O
for O

my O

hurting I-ADR
it O
feels O

there O

after O

all O
of O
this O

probably O
the O
lipitor O
, O
I O
am O
very O
worried O
now O
after O
reading O
all O

this O

feel O
I O
should O
quit O
taking O
it O

Suffered O
from O
depression B-ADR
after O
taking O
lipitor O
but O
did O
not O
realize O
connection O
. O
Stopped O
taking O
lipitor O
and O
depression B-ADR
left O
within O
days O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
take O
lipitor O
in O
any O
dose O
at O
any O
time O
. O
It O
made O
me O
realize O
the O
dangers O
of O
drugs O
. O

After O
about O
4 O
months O
of O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
one O
day O
while O
walking O
, O
my O
left B-ADR
leg I-ADR
, I-ADR
below I-ADR
the I-ADR
knee I-ADR
, I-ADR
experienced I-ADR
intense I-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
stiffness I-ADR
. O
Symptoms O
have O
persisted O
for O
a O
week O
and O
after O
reading O
the O
comments O
on O
this O
board O
, O
I O
am O
stopping O
it O
. O
While O
it O
worked O
well O
by O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
this O
was O
a O
side O
affect O
. O

I O
had O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
severe B-ADR
abdominal I-ADR
pain I-ADR
which O
was O
constant O
for O
4 O
hours O
straight O
, O
vomiting B-ADR
, O
trembling B-ADR
, O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
nausea B-ADR
. O
Arthritic O
seemed O
to O
induce O
my O
menstrual B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and O
cause O
the O
pain B-ADR
to I-ADR
be I-ADR
severe I-ADR
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
drug O
to O
anyone O
, O
especially O
since O
I O
have O
never O
had O
such O
an O
adverse O
reaction O
to O
any O
other O
medication O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
would O
caution O
women O
not O
to O
take O
this O
medication O
while O
menstruating O
, O
since O
one O
side O
effect O
can O
be O
severe B-ADR

. O
I O
initially O
could O
n't O
tell O
I O
was O
taking O
it O
. O
About O
two O
years O
ago O
I O
started O
waking O
up O
with O
significant O
congestion B-ADR
with I-ADR
clear I-ADR
phlegm I-ADR
. O
Chest O
xray O
was O
clear O
. O
My O
doctor O
suspected O
allergies B-DIS
. O
Having O
2 O
pets O
that O
seemed O
reasonable O
. O
About O
a O
year O
ago O
my O
elbows B-ADR
would I-ADR
burn I-ADR
like I-ADR
fire I-ADR
at O
times O
when O
I O
rested O
my O
arms O
on O
a O
surface O
. O
This O
would O
come O
and O
go O
. O
I O
also O
began O
having O
trouble B-ADR
focusing I-ADR
while I-ADR
reading I-ADR
and O
would O
skip O
around O
. O
Two O
months O
ago O
my O
right B-ADR
heel I-ADR
became I-ADR
painful I-ADR
for O
no O
reason O
. O
The O
more O
I O
walked O
on O
it O
the O
worse O
it O
felt O
. O
I O
switched O
shoes O
with O
no O
change O
. O
It O
hurt O
enough O
that O
I O
began O
to O
worry O
I O
might O
end O
up O
on O
disability O
if O
it O
got O
much O
worse O
. O
I O
was O
recently O
out O
of O
state O
for O
two O
weeks O
and O
still O
had O
congestion B-ADR
in O
spite O
of O
being O
in O
a O
totally O
different O
environment O
. O
That O
was O
when O
I O
suspected O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
did O
some O
research O
on O
line O
and O
saw O
matches O
with O
all O
of O
my O
symptoms O
. O
I O
immediately O
stopped O
it O
and O
the O
next O
morning O
the O
congestion B-ADR
was O
80 O
% O
less O
. O
I O
saw O
my O
doctor O
who O
agreed O
I O
need O
to O
stop O
it O
. O
He O
explained O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
side O
affects O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
predict O
who O
will O
get O
which O
ones O
or O
when O
they O
will O
develop O
. O
The O
blood O
tests O
give O
a O
false O
sense O
of O
security O
since O
the O
results O
( O
like O
mine O
) O
can O
be O
normal O
yet O
other O
serious O
issues O
can O
develop O
. O

I O

three O

and O
have O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
and O
my O
LDL O
typically O
measures O
between O
40 O
and O
45 O
. O
This O
drug O
-- O
when O
combined O
with O
lifestyle O
changes O
-- O
certainly O
works O
well O
. O

Took O
10 O
mg O

approximately O
one O

Finally O
went O
off O
all O
statins O
when O
I O
experienced O
a O
particularly O
bad O
reaction O
when O
the O
doctor O
, O
with O
a O
gleam O
in O
his O
eye O
, O
recommended O
combining O
lipitor O
with O
Zeta O
. O
The O
results O
were O
so O
bad O
in O
terms O
of O
side O
-effects O
that O
I O
ceased O
all O
statins O
and O
discontinued O
the O
Zeta O
in O
short O
order O
. O
I O
now O
take O
no O
statins O
, O
no O
Zeta O
. O
Individually O
they O
have O
their O
own O
problems O
; O
combined O
they O
are O
extremely O
dangerous O
and O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
should O
be O
banned O
as O
a O
combination O
therapy O
. O
Probably O
safe O
in O
short O
doses O
, O
a O
very O
bad O
candidate O
for O
long O
-term O
use O
unless O
closely O
monitored O
and O
used O
in O
lowest O
possible O
safe O
dosage O
. O
Would O
warn O
other O
patients O
to O
NOT O
COMBINE O
LIPITOR O
OR O
OTHER O
STATIN O
WITH O
Zeta O
, O
a O
common O
tactic O
that O
you O
will O
most O
likely O
regret O
. O
Let O
the O
pharmaceutical O

take O
the O

's O
taken O
me O
almost O
a O

to O
realize O
this O

due O
to O
the O
medication O

The O
bleeding O
started O
almost O
immediately O
after O

the O

I O

massive I-ADR

I O
thought O
I O

I O
went O

the O
severity O
of O
the O
lower B-ADR
abdominal I-ADR

i O
was O
put O
on O
this O

quell O
the O

that O

this O

the O

quiting O
this O

very O

Had O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
my O
back O
( O
primarily O
small O
of O
my O
back O
) O
and O
down O
my O
leg O

I O
had O
tried O

the O
result O
was O
achy B-ADR
legs I-ADR
. O
After O
some O
time O
off O
of O
this O
drug O
and O
feeling O
better O
, O
I O
tried O
it O
again O
. O
My O
back O
hurt O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
went O
to O
a O
chiropractor O
twice O
and O
no O
relief O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
might O
have O
a O
bulging B-DIS
disc I-DIS

decided O
to O
go O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
again O
. O
After O
two O
months O
, O
I O
' O
m O
back O
to O
normal O
. O
I O
call O
this O
the O
drug O
from O
hell O
. O

I O
took O
Lipitor O
for O
about O
a O
year O
. O
I O
had O
vague O
muscle B-ADR
aches I-ADR
and O
almost O
overnight O
developed O
low B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
where O
I O
had O
to O
roll O
out O
of O
bed O
in O
order O
to O
stand O
up O
without O
pain O
. O
I O
told O
my O
doctor O
I O
took O
myself O
off O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
know O
my O
own O
body O
after O
65 O
yrs O
and O
I O
NEVER O
had O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
before O
. O
What O
else O
could O
I O
attribute O
this O
pain B-ADR
to O
? O
Why O
is O
there O
such O
denial O
as O
to O
the O
damage O
this O
drug O
can O
do O

was O

could O

why O
these O

made O

Sciatic B-DIS
Endo I-DIS
is O
rarely O

me O
. O
I O
do O
Restorative O
Yoga O
postures O
to O
get O
myself O
loosened O
up O
every O
day O
, O
but O
keep O
the O
Cataflam O
handy O
as O
nothing O
works O
better O
for O
the O
pain B-DIS
, O
unless O
I O
have O
an O
extremely O
bad O
time O
where O
I O
have O
to O
take O
a O
Demerol O
with O
it O
( O
rarely O
) O
. O
However O
, O
I O
have O
noticed O
in O
the O
$ O
patient O
info O
$ O
they O
give O
with O
my O
Rx O
that O
now O
warnings O
of O
NSAID O
's O
causing O
heart B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
and O
strokes B-DIS
are O
written O
where O
they O
were O
not O
before O
when O
I O
started O
this O
Rx O
. O
The O
best O
dose O
for O
me O
( O
per O
my O
doctor O
) O
is O
2 O
pills O
to O
get O
in O
your O
system O
, O
then O
1 O
every O
8 O
hours O
afterward O
. O
Luckily O
, O
I O
only O
need O
this O
a O
few O
days O
a O
week O
at O
the O
most O
, O
here O
& O
there O
. O
I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
especially O
for O
lower B-DIS
lumbar I-DIS
arthritis I-DIS
and O
to O
women O
for O
dysmenorrhea B-DIS
. O
it O
will O
do O
the O
trick!. O

Just O
before O
this O
last O
Christmas O
I O
had O
a O
small O
stroke B-DIS
and O
spent O
three O
days O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O
To O
make O
a O
long O
story O
short O
, O
there O
are O
no O
after O
effects O
of O
the O
stroke O
. O
In O
other O
words O
the O
symptoms O
went O
away O
. O
But O
, O
my O
Doc O
put O
me O
on O
Aggrenox O
and O
20 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
have O
very O
high O
arches O
and O
have O
had O
a O
little O
tingling B-ADR
in O
my O
feet O
for O
years O
. O
This O
is O
really O
helped O
with O
a O
good O
arch O
support O
. O
But O
for O
the O
last O
two O
months O
the O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
feet O
and O
calves O
( O
and O
sometimes O
thigh O
) O
has O
gotten O
much O
worse O
. O
I O
can B-ADR
not I-ADR
walk I-ADR
very O
far O
and O
sleeping O
has O
become O
a O
problem O
because O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O
Because O
of O
the O
preexisting O
arch B-DIS
problem I-DIS
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
naturally O
getting O
worse O
but O
after O
finding O
this O
web O
site O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
is O
not O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
On O
a O
pain B-ADR
scale O
it O
has O
gone O
from O
a O
1 O
or O
2 O
to O
7 O
or O
8 O
. O
I O
have O
a O
followup O
anointment O
with O
my O
Doctor O
in O
two O
days O
and O
was O
thinking O
of O
asking O
him O
if O
I O
could O
go O
off O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
. O

Cognitive B-ADR
disfunction I-ADR
, O

, O
extreme B-ADR

, O

weakness I-ADR
and O
difficulty B-ADR
walking I-ADR
. O
I O
consider O
this O
to O
be O
an O
extremely O
dangerous O
drug O
. O
I O
can O
only O
hope O
that O
some O
day O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
lead O
a O
normal O
life O
again O

. O
It O
dramatically O
reduced O
my O
cholesterol O
but O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
n't O
worth O
the O
benefits O
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
medical O
center O
today O
because O
I O
was O
feeling O
so O
bad O
. O
I O
have O
Lupus B-DIS
so O
I O
assumed O
that O
it O
was O
causing O
me O
to O
feel O
bad O
. O
After O
hearing O
my O
symptoms O
, O
my O
doctor O
told O
me O
to O
using O
Lipitor O
for O
awhile O
to O
see O
if O
the O
symptoms O
go O
away O
. O
It O
never O
dawned O
on O
me O
that O
it O
could O
be O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
Now O
that O
I O
found O
your O
website O
I O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
. O

I O
think O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
ok O
with O
this O
medication O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
when O
I O
was O
19 O
, O
I O
' O
m O
now O
38 O
and O
started O
on O
Lipitor O
when O
I O
was O
31 O
. O
Prior O
to O
starting O
Lipitor O
my O
cholesterol O
level O
was O
8.45(Canada),in O
Nov/03 O
my O
level O
was O
down O
to O
6.24 O
. O
Its O
still O
a O
bit O
high,(Canada O
the O
levels O
are O
measured O
different O
then O
the O
US O
, O
levels O
should O
be O
below O
5.20 O
) O
. O
My O
mother O
and O
I O
are O
both O
recipients O
of O
high B-DIS
cholesterol I-DIS
. O
I O
do O
suffer O
migrans B-ADR
, O
back B-ADR
aches I-ADR
sore B-ADR

. O
I O
do O
exercise O
regularly O
, O
but O
still O
have O

I O
am O
always B-ADR
tired I-ADR
, O
but O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
this O
is O
caused O
by O
the O
medication O
. O
I O
have O
never O
mentioned O
this O
to O
my O
doctor O
, O
because O
I O
just O
thought O
this O
was O
caused O
by O
my O
job O
and O
being O
run O
down O
with O
dealing O
with O
my O
children O
. O

My B-ADR
feet I-ADR

I O
get O
up O

I B-ADR
walk I-ADR
like I-ADR
an I-ADR
old I-ADR
person I-ADR
. O
My O
doctor O
noticed O
a O
rough O
sound O
in O
my O
lungs O
and O
a O
heart O
murmur O
that O
was O
never O
mentioned O
before O
. O
I O
' O
m O
having O
tests O
next O
week O
for O
both O
. O
I O
was O
OK O
taking O
20 O
mg O
but O
the O
doctor O
raised O
me O
to O
40 O
mg O
about O
4 O
months O
ago O
. O
It O
's O
only O
since O
then O
that O
I O
' O
ve O
had O
these O

I O
'll O
probably O

Because O
so O

are O
so O

what O

either O

the O

I O

it O

A O

of O
the O
symptoms O
I O
listed O
( O
mostly O

) O
quickly O
appeared O
when O
I O
began O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
became O
slowly O
more O
intense O
and O
more O
of O
them O
came O
into O
the O
picture O
as O
each O
year O
passed O
. O
I O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor O
recently O
out O
of O
desperation O
and O
most O
all O
symptoms O
improved O
greatly O
within O
days O
of O
stopping O
. O
I O
do O
not O
plan O
to O
resume O
it O
and O
will O
find O
some O
other O
way O
to O
control O
things O
. O

Lipitor O
is O
the O
only O
prescription O
drug O
I O
take O
and O
have O
taken O
it O
for O
four O
years O
now O
. O
I O
have O
noticed O
I O
am O
gaining B-ADR
excess I-ADR
weight I-ADR
even O
though O
I O
am O
not O
eating O
more O
. O
My O
stomach B-ADR
is I-ADR

, I-ADR
with I-ADR
excess I-ADR

( O
although O
could O
be O
the O
weight O

) O
. O
I O
also O
am O
experiencing O
increased B-ADR
memory I-ADR
loss I-ADR
, O
and O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
but O
then O
I O
rarely B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
well I-DIS
( O
due O
to O
night B-DIS
sweats I-DIS
) O
since O
I O
went O
through O
menopause B-DIS
ten O
years O
ago O
. O
I O
think O
some O
of O
my O
symptoms O
are O
related O
to O
being O
post O
menopausal B-DIS
rather O
than O
from O
the O
Lipitor O
. O

My O

I O
stopped O

now O
for O
40 O
days O
and O
joint B-ADR

is O
slowly O
improving O
and O
not O
as O
bad O
. O
I O
have O
lost O
trust O
in O
most O
doctors O
. O
they O
are O
only O
doing O
what O
they O
know O
, O
which O
is O
very O

there O
are O
natural O

what O
I O

( I-ADR

I O
thought B-ADR
for I-ADR
sure I-ADR
that I-ADR
I I-ADR
was I-ADR

The O

a O

MRA O
, O
Echocardiogram O
, O

of O
the O

and O
first O
termed O
it O
a O
TIA B-DIS

But O
since O
that O
time O
the O
doctors O
have O
backed O
down O
from O
that O
diagnosis O
. O
A O
week O
later O
I O
had O
several O
( O
22 O
) O
episodes O
of O
the O
body B-ADR
flushes I-ADR
( O
within O
a O
5 O
hour O

) O
which O
sent O
me O
back O
to O
the O
hospital O

After O
several O
doctors O
, O
they O
are O
saying O
now O
that O
it O
was O
probably O
caused O
by O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
I O
am O
not O
taking O
it O
any O
more O
and O
have O
not O
had O
any O

for O
10 O
days O
. O
This O
was O
after O
only O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
for O
21 O
days O
. O
The O
only O
good O
thing O
that O
came O
from O
all O
of O
this O

was O
that O
they O
did O
find O
a O
brain B-DIS
aneurysm I-DIS
which O
I O
am O
having O
taken O
care O
of O
by O
a. O

Was O
doing O
fine O
on O
it O
for O
years O

I O
unfortunately O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Colin B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
and O
had O
to O
start O
chemotherapy O
. O
The O
combo O
of O
chemo O
and O
Lipitor O
caused O
my O
liver B-ADR

to I-ADR
rise I-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR

joint I-ADR

as O
well O

up O

ask O
you O

What O
medicines O
do O
you O

? O
Now O
all O
they O

BEWARE O

After O
about O
4 O
years O
of O
taking O
Lipitor O
I O
started O
experiencing O
severe B-ADR
leg I-ADR
cramping I-ADR
at O
night O
with O
the O
pain B-ADR
traveling O
to O
my O
bundocks O
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
pain B-ADR
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
Advil O
for O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
Lipitor O
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinary B-DIS
tract I-DIS
infection I-DIS
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-ADR
to I-ADR
urinate I-ADR
constantly I-ADR
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
hamlet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
mor O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case O
-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

No O
known O
side O

. O
Lowered O

within O
30 O

the O

after O

it O
never O

that O
again O

recently O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
feeling B-ADR
like I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
is I-ADR
full I-ADR
and I-ADR
empty I-ADR
at I-ADR
the I-ADR
same I-ADR
time I-ADR
hard O
to O

that O
s O
what O
it O
felt O
like O
, O
and O
also O
have O
been O
getting O
bruises B-ADR
allover O
my O
body O
due O
to O
this O

other O
than O
that O
my O
back O
is O
back O
to O
normal O
now O
and O
i O
am O
back O
at O
work O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
this O
medication O
for O
approximately O
two O
years O
and O
it O
has O
been O
very O
affective O
in O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
; O
however O
, O
I O
did O
notice O
that O
I O
became O
depressed B-ADR
with O
intermittent O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
I O
recently O
mentioned O
this O
to O
my O
physician O
and O
asked O
if O
he O
knew O
if O
this O
particular O
medication O
causes O
these O
symptoms O
as O
all O
my O
blood O
studies O
for O
liver O
function O
, O
etc O
have O
been O
normal O
. O
I O
decided O
to O
stop O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
I O
felt O
so O
much O
better O
. O
I O
will O
call O
him O
tomorrow O
and O
ask O
if O
I O
can O
be O
switched O
to O
another O
medication O
. O
It O
is O
a O
very O
effective O
medication O
, O
but O
obviously O
has O
its O
problems O
as O
indicated O
by O
those O
patients O
who O
had O
very O
similar O
effects O
. O

muscle B-ADR

AND O
UNCHARACTERISTIC O
DEPRESSION B-ADR
, O
ANXIETY B-ADR
, O
AGGRESSION B-ADR
, O
AND O
MOOD B-ADR
SWINGS I-ADR
. O
I O
can O
not O
stress O
this O
enough- O
my O
personality O
completely O
changed O
after O
beginning O
this O
medication O
. O
I O
am O
typically O
an O
easy O
going O
, O
positively O
thinking O
, O
emotionally O
stable O
, O
and O
motivated O
person O
. O
But O
after O
starting O
Lipitor O
I O
' O
ve O
gradually O
descended O
into O
a O
world O
of O
extreme O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
hopelessness B-ADR
, O
loneliness B-ADR
, O
and O
self B-ADR
loathing I-ADR
. O
I O
' O
ve O
never O
in O
my O
life O
been O
so O
depressed B-ADR
, O
so O
obsessively B-ADR
focused I-ADR
on I-ADR
morbid I-ADR
, O
terrifying B-ADR
thoughts I-ADR
, O
or O
so O
negative B-ADR
about I-ADR
everything I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
life I-ADR
. O
After O
being O
off O
of O
this O
medication O
for O
only O
48 O
hours O
, O
I O
am O
already O
beginning O
to O
see O
an O
improvement O
in O
my O
moods O
, O
but O
this O
will O
be O
a O
long O
journey O
back O
to O
my O
old O
self O
, O
I O
feel O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
I O
also O
suffered O
from O
: O
Gas B-ADR
, O
Constipation B-ADR
, O
EXTREME O
FATIGUE B-ADR
, O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
and O
bloating B-ADR
, O
and O
occasional O
bouts O
of O
diaharrea B-ADR
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
But O
it O
also O
significantly O
lowered O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
This O
website O
has O
been O
an O
absolute O
lifeline O
for O
me O
. O
My O
doctor O
had O
seemed O
so O
completely O
unwilling O
to O
accept O
that O
my O
symptoms O
could O
' O
ve O
possibly O
been O
related O
to O
my O
taking O
Lipitor O
. O
However O
, O
I O
know O
my O
body O
and O
know O
when O
things O
are O
not O
as O
they O
should O
be O
. O
I O
have O
been O
feeling O
this O
way O
since O
almost O
immediately O
after O
I O
took O
my O
first O
dose O
. O
Hearing O
that O
so O
many O
other O
people O
have O
experienced O
the O
same O
exact O
symptoms O
as O
me O
has O
given O
me O
the O
courage O
needed O
to O
STOP O
this O
medication O
. O
So O
many O
of O
my O
family O
members O
and O
friends O
have O
had O
bad O
reactions O
to O
this O

When O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
was O
amazed O
at O
how O
much O
better O
I O
began O
to O
feel O
. O
While O
taking O
Lipitor O
I O
had O
stomach B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
every O
day O
. O
I O
was O
tired B-ADR
, O
and O
could O
not O
function O
normal O
. O

I O
took O
this O
medication O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
. O
On O
day O
two O
I O
noticed O
a O
rash B-ADR
on O
the O
outside O
part O
of O
my O
left O
arm O
, O
then O
the O
it O
spread O
to O
to O
my O
back O
and O
front O
of O
my O
neck O
by O
day O
three O
. O
I O
also O
noticed O
some O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
bloated B-ADR
stomach I-ADR
, O
gas B-ADR
, O
and O
muscle B-ADR
weakness I-ADR
specially O
in O
my O
back O
. O
I O
had O
kidney B-ADR
pain I-ADR
on O
the O
right O
side O
to O
the O
point O
I O
could O
not O
bend O
forward O
. O
I O
stoped O
taking O
this O
medication O
by O
the O
second O
week O
I O
was O
on O
it O
, O
however O
it O
is O
taking O
me O
a O
while O
to O
get O
better O
from O
the O
weakness B-ADR
, O
the O
rash B-ADR
is O
improving O
but O
my O
skin O
is O
stained O
with O
multiple O
brown O
dots O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
medication O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
the O
drug O
has O
definitely O
worked O
but O
I O
have O
developed O
almost O
a O
debilitating B-ADR
problem I-ADR
with I-ADR
both I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
arms I-ADR
. O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
move O
them O
in O
any O
direction O
but O
the O
normal O
motion O
. O
It O
has O
got O
to O
the O
point O
where O
turning O
over O
in O
bed O
wakes O
me O
up O
because O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
it O
causes O
. O
I O
have O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
to O
determine O
if O
Lipitor O
is O
causing O
this O
serious O
problem O
and O
the O
results O
said O
no O
it O
was O
n't O
. O
However O
, O
I O
even O
went O
to O
an O
orthopedic O
surgeon O
and O
after O
he O
checked O
me O
out O
, O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
drugs O
that O
I O
take O
( O
i O
am O
also O
a O
type O

diabetic O
) O
and O
he O
said O
ahh O

Last O
48 O
hours O

episodes O
seemed O

two O

with O
excellent O

down O
from O
295 O
in O

, O
consistent O
with O
the O

ten O

also O
showed O
no O
calcium B-DIS

one O
week O

Was O
on O
a O
dose O

40 O

. O
Will O
see O
how O
muscle O
symptoms O
are O
in O
a O
month O
and O
try O
to O
resume O
at O
10 O
mg O
. O
Does O
anyone O
know O
how O
long O
they O
think O
it O
should O
take O
symptoms O
to O
go O
away O
? O
. O

Have O
suffered O
from O
leg B-ADR
cramps(principally O
at O
night O
) O
since O
beginning O
40 O
mg O
Lipitor O
, O
5 O
years O
ago O
, O
after O
a O
mild O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
. O
Cardiologist O
offered O
no O
suggestions O
. O
After O
trying O
numerous O
recommendation O
for O
this O
problem O
such O
as O
potassium O
, O
magnesium O
, O
vitamin O
E O
, O
etc O
with O
no O
effect O
, O
my O
family O
doctor O
suggested O
that O
I O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor O
for O
3 O
days O
, O
and O
see O
if O
it O
has O
any O
effect O
. O
The O
effect O
was O
dramatic O
. O
The O
cramps B-ADR
did O
not O
occur O
during O
the O
night O
after O
I O
did O
not O
take O
the O
40 O
mg O
with O
my O
dinner O
. O
They O
also O
did O
not O
occur O
on O
the O
following O
two O
nights O
. O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
restart O
the O
Lipitor O
( O
once O
a O
day O
with O
the O
evening O
meal O
) O
for O
fear O
that O
the O
cramps B-ADR
would O
just O
as O
quickly O
return O
. O
Since O
it O
was O
possible O
that O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
night O
cramps B-ADR
ceased O
so O
quickly O
is O
that O
I O
was O
taking O
the O
40 O
mg O
entirely O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
split O
the O
pills O
and O
take O
half O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
half O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
Although O
some O
mild O
cramping B-ADR
did O
return O
, O
it O
was O
nowhere O
close O
to O
what O
I O
had O
been O
experiencing O
, O
and O
this O
has O
c. O

My O
hair B-ADR
is I-ADR
getting I-ADR
very I-ADR
thin I-ADR
, O
after O
being O
on O
cholesterol O
lowering O
drugs O
for O
20 O
yrs O
. O
Lipitor O
, O
for O
the O
last O
8 O
yrs O
. O
Did O
n't O
know O
this O
was O
a O
side O
effect O
. O
Do O
all O
cholesterol O
lowering O
drugs O
cause O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
? O
. O

The O
pill O
eliminated O
all O
pain B-DIS
I I-DIS
felt I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
hip I-DIS
, O
but O
it O
was O
hard B-ADR
on I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
. O
On O
my O
10th O
day O
of O
medication O
, O
I O
experienced O
vaginal B-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
. O
This O
scared O
me O
because O
it O
was O
two O
weeks O
after O
my O
normal O
period O
. O
There O
is O
something O
really O
fishy O
about O
this O
drug O
. O
I O
do O
not O
advise O
anyone O
to O
take O
it O
as O
there O
are O
many O
adverse O

Lipitor O

, O
but O
for O
me O
it O
was O
at O
a O
terrible O
cost O
to O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
At O
first O
, O
I O
had O
no O
problems O
. O
Problems O
began O
gradually O
and O
I O
never O
put O
it O
together O
until O
my O
GYN O
said O
STOP O
taking O
Lipitor O
! O
Over O
this O
time O
, O
I O
gradually O
began O
to O
feel O
like O
an O
old O
, O
old O
lady O
and O
I O
was O
taking O
medication O
for O
arthritis B-DIS
and O
being O
tested O
for O
sorren B-DIS
's I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
also O
joking O
about O
developing O
alzheimers B-DIS
but O
was O
really O
terrified O
of O
my O
memory B-ADR
problems I-ADR
and O
slurred B-ADR
speech I-ADR
! O
My O
interest O
never O
suggested O
it O
could O
be O
the O
lipitor O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
off O
1 O
month O
and O
it O
's O
been O
like O
waking O
up O
from O
a O
bad O
dream O
. O
Every O
day O
has O
been O
better O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
continues O

! O
I O
took O

it O

Doctors O
unable O
to O
connect O
the O

( O
Lipitor O
above O
symptoms O
) O
. O
Sure O
it O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
But O
at O
what O
cost O
? O
I O
told O
my O
doctor O
I O
was O
feeling B-ADR
weak I-ADR
. O
He O
commented O
I O
see O
NO O
reason O
for O
you O
to O
be O
weak B-ADR
( O
Even O
though O
he O
prescribed O
the O
Lipitor O
for O
me O
) O
Well O
needless O
to O
say O
that O
was O
the O
last O
time O
I O
saw O
him O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
MS B-DIS
, O
Lupus B-DIS
, O
Fibromyalgia B-DIS
or O
some O
other O
illness O
that O
has O
the O
symptoms O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
found O
that O
Lipitor O
could O
be O
the O
reason O
for O
all O
of O
these O
symptoms O
. O
So O
, O
on O
my O
own O
, O
I O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor O
( O
I O
was O
only O
on O
10 O
mg O
per O
day O
) O
Within O
48 O
hours O
I O
felt O
my O
mood O
elevating O
back O
to O
normal O
. O
So O
far O
( O
I O
' O
ve O
been O
off O
of O
it O
for O
about O
5 O
days O
now O
) O
, O
my O
chest B-ADR
pain I-ADR
has O
improved O
by O
about O
75 O
% O
. O
This O
is O
no O
coincidence O
I O
am O
certain O
. O
Hopefully O
my O
other O
symptoms O
of O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
memory B-ADR
and O
insomnia B-ADR
will O
alleviate O
as O
well O
. O
By O
the O
way O
. O
my O
new O
doctor O
had O
prescribed O
an O
anti O
-depressant O
for O
me O
. O
I O
never O
filled O
it O
, O
as O
my O
instincts O
told O
me O
it O
was O
something O
more O

I O
am O
generally O

that O

the O
only O

a O

it O

4 O

I O
ended O
up O
in O
the O

hospitalized O
. O
My O
drs O
dismissed O

as O
the O
reason O
yet O
my O

NSAIDS O
$ O
listed O
under O
patient O

. O
? O
. O

Was O
on O
Pravachol O
. O
Dr O
switched O
me O
to O
Lipitor O
since O
he O
said O
it O
was O
more O
effective O
. O
After O
78 O
days O
on O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
had O
constant B-ADR
low I-ADR
level I-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
my O
butt O
and O
upper O
thighs O
. O
Strong B-ADR
pain I-ADR
would O
come O
and O
go O
randomly O
. O
There O
would O
be O
spikes B-ADR
of I-ADR
pain I-ADR
so I-ADR
severe I-ADR
that O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
would O
collapse O
. O
Would O
have O
to O
stop O
standing O
/walking O
and O
sit O
down O
for O
5 O
or O
10 O
minutes O
. O
After O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor O
, O
the O
pain B-ADR
gradually O
subsided O
over O
a O
9 O
month O
period O
. O
I O
was O
pain B-ADR
free O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
but O
the O
same O
pain B-ADR
has O
returned O
and O
has O
been O
with O
me O
for O
the O
past O
5 O
months O
. O
I O
now O
wonder O
if O
this O
is O
a O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
condition I-DIS
. O

If O
you O
have O
a O
severe B-DIS
pain I-DIS
of O
unknown O
origin O
this O
is O
the O
best O
I O
' O
ve O
suffered O
for O
almost O
4 O
month O
without O
knowing O
a O
reason O
. O
It O
was O
a O
disaster O
You O
have O
any O
problem O
do O
not O
hesitate O
. O
first O
of O
all O
have O
an O
oral O
swab O
in O
any O
laboratory O
. O

Anxiety B-ADR
, O
paranoia B-ADR
. O
I O
went O
to O
see O
my O
doctor O
and O
told O
him O
about O
my O
discovery O
. O
First O
he O
was O
a O
bit O
reluctant O
but O
in O
the O
following O
meeting O
he O
already O
told O
me O
that O
he O
had O
read O
about O
Lipitor O
's O
psychiatric B-DIS
side O
effects O
. O
He O
therefore O
put O
me O
off O
Lipitor O
completely O
and O
suggested O
a O
much O
lower O
dosage O
of O
10 O
mg O
Crestor O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
he O
prescribed O
a O
new O
medication O
: O
Niacin O
, O
beginning O
with O
500 O
mg O
the O
first O
month O
and O
then O
increasing O
to O
1,000 O
in O
the O
second O
( O
with O
the O
ultimate O
aim O
of O
reaching O
2,000 O
in O
the O
fourth O
monthly O
) O
. O
Bottom O
line O
: O
When O
I O
discontinued O
Lipitor O
two O
months O
ago O
my O
LDL O
reached O
165 O
. O
This O
week O
my O
blood O
test O
indicated O
an O
LDL O
level O
of O
124 O
. O
So O
, O
after O
being O
helped O
by O
folks O
on O
this O
website O
I O
hope O
I O
can O
be O
of O
some O
help O
to O
others O
who O
suffer O
from O
statin O
side O
effects O
. O
Therefore O
, O
here O
is O
what O
I O
' O
ve O
done O
during O
the O
past O
two O
months O
: O
- O
Took O
500 O
mg O
of O
Niacin O
during O
the O
first O
months O
and O
1,000 O
mg O
during O
the O
second O
; O
- O
Took O
a O
total O
of O
10 O
Crestor O
pills O
( O
10 O
mg O
which O
are O
equivalent O
to O
20 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
) O
per O
month O
, O
i.e. O
, O
one O
every O
three O
days O
. O
- O
Two O
natural O
pills O
of O
Phytosterol O
. O
- O
A O
cup O
of O
tea O
made O
of O
olive O
leafs O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
do O
believe O
that O
when O
I O
reach O
the O
maximum O
intake O
of O
Niacin O
in O
two O
months O
( O
2,000 O
mg O
) O
the O
LDL O
will O
drop O
from O
124 O
to O
100 O
( O
the O
level O
required O
for O
diabetics B-DIS
) O
. O
Good O
luck O

the O

I O

( O
one O
@ O

the O
other O
@ O

for O
a O

of O

when O
I O
was O
alerted O
to O
possible O
long O

then O
consulted O
my O

who O
advised O
because O
of O
the O

I O
had O
been O
taking O
them O
to O
only O
take O
them O
on O
a O
$ O

I O
immediately O
stopped O
completely O

found O
that O
I O
had O
muscular B-DIS
pains I-DIS
all O
over O
my O

, O
I O
have O
now O
reduced O
my O

to O
one O

find O
that O
this O
has O
proved O
a O

next O

my O

I O
will O
never O

dry B-ADR

( O
also O
taking O
cymbalta O

. O
when O
i O
first O
took O
voltaren O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
feel O
it O
helped O
me O
at O
all O
. O
however O
when O
i O
stopped O
, O
i O
was O
in O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
pain B-DIS
the O
following O
day O
. O
when O
i O
restarted O
it O
, O
i O
started O
feeling O
better O
. O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
pain B-DIS
, O
but O
does O
seem O
to O
make O
it O
more O
bearable O
. O

Initially O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
slight O
, O
but O
noticeable O
difference O
in O
pain O
level O
: O
the O
pain B-DIS
was I-DIS
less I-DIS
severe I-DIS
. O
Within O
a O
few O
days O
, O
I O
noticed O
acid B-ADR
reflux I-ADR
shortly O
after O
taking O
, O
and O
it O
got O
progressively O
worse O
. O
It O
got O
to O
the O
point O
that O
I O
was O
apprehensive O
about O
going O
to O
bed O
; O
I O
consistently O
found O
myself O
waking O
up O
with O
acidic B-ADR
bile I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
mouth I-ADR
, O
tasting O
like O
I O

it O

After O

and O
intense O

I O
am O
so O
relieved O
to O
get O
so O

. O

I O
have O
had O
tendonitis B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
knees I-ADR
and O
troublesome O
pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
lower I-ADR
legs I-ADR
and I-ADR
feet I-ADR
. O
My O
knee B-ADR
swells I-ADR
with O
fluid O
, O
so O
that O
any O
movement O
causes O
excruciating B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O
At O
first O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
this O
might O
be O
gout B-DIS
, O
because O
it O
runs O
in O
my O
family O
, O
and O
my O
toes B-DIS
swell I-DIS
up I-DIS
occasionally O
. O
But O
, O
after O
my O
doctor O
confirmed O
that O
my O
swollen B-ADR
knees I-ADR
were O
not O
gout B-DIS
, O
I O
began O
to O
consider O
other O
causes O
. O
It O
dawned O
on O
me O
to O
check O
the O
internet O
concerning O
the O
Lipitor O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
. O
Sure O
enough O
, O
many O
people O
have O
the O
same O
troubles O
. O
I O
used O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
for O
endless O
miles O
. O
For O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
time O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
have O
been O
hobbling B-ADR
around I-ADR
, O
cautious O
of O
every O
painful O
step O
. O
Although O
it O
may O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
tomorrow O
, O
I O
will O
stop O
taking O
the O
Lipitor O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor O
for O
3 O
months O
. O
After O
1 O
month O
I O
had O
severe O
diarrhoea B-ADR
which O
cleared O
after O
1 O
week O
, O
so O
I O
paid O
no O
attention O
to O
it O
. O
Excessive B-ADR
gas I-ADR
another O
symptom O
which O
persists O
. O
For O
the O
past O
2 O

I O
have O
had O

( O
which O
I O
have O
experienced O
before O
) O
but O
this O
time O
not O
cured O
by O
chiropractic O
treatment O
. O
I O
was O
puzzled O
! O
! O
Recently O
after O
walking O
for O
a O
while O
I O
experienced O
severe B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
right I-ADR
leg I-ADR
from O
thigh O
to O
knee O
and O
then O
to O
ankle O
which O
caused B-ADR
me I-ADR
to I-ADR
limp I-ADR
. O
I O
found O
this O
website O
and O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
similar O
symptoms O
as O
others O
who O
take O
this O
medication O
. O
I O
see O
my O
GP O
tomorrow O
for O
the O
results O
of O
my O
first O
3 O

After O

from O

taken O

I O
believe O
this O

caused O
the O
severe B-ADR

I O
' O
ve O
experienced O
over O
the O

Countless O

cut O

and O
have O
experienced O

several O

a O

It O
is O
making O
me O
feel O

I O

I O

him O
that O
I O
quit O

and O
already O
feel O
a O
LOT O
BETTER O
except O
for O
the O
very B-ADR
sore I-ADR
neck I-ADR
. O
He O
said O
that O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
and O
that O
it O
was O
doing O
more O
harm O
than O
good O
. O
I O
have O
been O
browsing O
the O
internet O
a O
lot O
in O
the O
last O
week O
and O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
are O
having O
problems O
with O
Lipitor O
! O
A O
doctor O
Peter O
H. O
Langston O
says O
in O
July O
8 O
, O
2002 O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Lipitor O
for O
approximately O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
losing B-ADR
muscular I-ADR
, O
headache B-ADR
, O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and I-ADR
stiffness I-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
memory B-ADR

, O
muscles B-ADR
pain I-ADR
on I-ADR
the I-ADR
left I-ADR
side I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
chest I-ADR
, O
depression B-ADR
, O
sleepless B-ADR
nites I-ADR
and O
balance B-ADR
loss I-ADR
. O
It O
work O
great O
on O
reducing O
cholesterol O
level O
, O
but O
its O
side O
effects O
became O
another O
problem O
for O
me O
. O
I O
will O
discuss O
it O
with O
my O
doctor O
in O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

It O
began O
with O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
then O
slight B-ADR
nausea I-ADR
, O
then O
reflux B-ADR
each O
time O
I O
took O
a O
pill O
. O
After O
the O
second O
pill O
the O
same O
progression O
of O
symptoms O
only O
now O
the O
abdominal B-ADR
gas I-ADR
, I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and I-ADR
pain I-ADR
would O
be O
with O
me O
all O
day O
. O
I O
stopped O
pills O
but O
abdominal B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
persist O
. O
The O
only O
good O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
Arthritic O
is O
that O
I O
did O
notice O
pain B-DIS
relief O
but O
I O
wo O
n't O
put O
up O
with O
the O
side O
effects O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
since O
I O
spent O
a O
long O
time O
getting O
rid O
of O
a O
reflux B-DIS
problem O
in O
the O
past O
. O
The O
abdominal B-ADR
gas I-ADR
, I-ADR
cramps I-ADR
and I-ADR
discomfort I-ADR
are O
another O
thing O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
see O
get O
worse O
if O
I O
keep O
taking O
Arthritic O
. O
I O
' O
ve O
taken O
Tylenol O
3 O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
like O
this O
. O
Perhaps O
there O
is O
something O
not O
right O
yet O
with O
Arthritic O
. O

pain B-ADR
in I-ADR
knee I-ADR
and I-ADR
foot I-ADR
. O

I O
am O
menstruating B-ADR
with I-ADR
heavy I-ADR
bleeding I-ADR
every I-ADR
11 I-ADR
days I-ADR
. O
Honestly O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
figure O
out O
how O
I O
can O
lose O
this O
much O
blood O
and O
still O
function O
. O
I O
have O
horrific B-ADR
cramps I-ADR
to O
begin O
with O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
whether O
arthritic O
increased O
that O
. O
I O
have O
endometriosis B-DIS
, O
so O
I O
' O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
is O
something O
that O
does O
n't O
agree O
with O
arthritic O
. O
It O
did O
help O
with O
the O
pain B-DIS
I O
experience O
with O
the O
pinched O
nerve O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
to O
continue O
. O

i O
am O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
results O
. O

after O
one O
week O
i O
started O
with O
chest B-ADR
tightness I-ADR
and O
numbness B-ADR
aching I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
to I-ADR
my I-ADR
left I-ADR
arm I-ADR
also O
pain B-ADR
between I-ADR
both I-ADR
shoulder I-ADR
blades I-ADR
. O
also O
would O
wake O
up O
feeling B-ADR
shaker I-ADR
headache B-ADR
and O
just O
more B-ADR
tiered I-ADR
. O
called O
my O
dr O
. O
he O
said O
to O
stop O
takeing O
it O
. O
so O
now O
i O
must O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
with O
diet O
and O
exercise O
. O
not O
for O
all O
. O

I O
am O
writing O
this O
for O
my O
husband O
. O
He O
initially O
took O
10 O
mg O
every O
other O
day O
several O
years O
ago O
but O
would O
complain O
of O
muscle B-ADR
soreness I-ADR
and O
tore B-DIS
a I-DIS
calf I-DIS
muscle I-DIS
while O
running O
once O
. O
At O
that O
point O
he O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor O
and O
improved O
. O
Fast O
forward O
3 O
years O
, O
he O
went O
to O
dr O
for O
check O
up O
( O
he O
has O
known O
coronary B-DIS
disease I-DIS
) O
and O
was O
started O
back O
on O
Lipitor O
20 O
mg O
. O
At O
about O
2 O
months O
in O
, O
he O
had O
nausea B-ADR
and O
sweating B-ADR
occasionally O
. O
One O
month O
later O
he O
ended O
up O
in O
hospital O
for O
coronary B-DIS
disease I-DIS
and O
dose O
up O
to O
40 O

After O
